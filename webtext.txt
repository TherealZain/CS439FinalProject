Eating a healthy, balanced diet is an important part of maintaining good health, and can help you feel your best.This means eating a wide variety of foods in the right proportions, and consuming the right amount of food and drink to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.This page covers healthy eating advice for the general population.People with special dietary needs or a medical condition should ask their doctor or a registered dietitian for advice.The Eatwell Guide shows that to have a healthy, balanced diet, people should try to:If you're having foods and drinks that are high in fat, salt and sugar, have these less often and in small amounts.Try to choose a variety of different foods from the 5 main food groups to get a wide range of nutrients.Most people in the UK eat and drink too many calories, too much saturated fat, sugar and salt, and not enough fruit, vegetables, oily fish or fibre.The Eatwell Guide does not apply to children under the age of 2 because they have different nutritional needs.After the age of 2 years, children should move to eating the same foods as the rest of the family in the proportions shown in the Eatwell Guide.Fruit and vegetables are a good source of vitamins and minerals and fibre, and should make up just over a third of the food you eat each day.It's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.There's evidence that people who eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day have a lower risk of heart disease, stroke and some cancers.Eating 5 portions is not as hard as it sounds.A portion is:Just 1 apple, banana, pear or similar-sized fruit is 1 portion each.A slice of pineapple or melon is also 1 portion, and 3 heaped tablespoons of vegetables is another portion.Adding a tablespoon of dried fruit, such as raisins, to your morning cereal is an easy way to get 1 portion.You could also swap your mid-morning biscuit for a banana, and add a side salad to your lunch. In the evening, have a portion of vegetables with dinner and fresh fruit with plain, lower fat yoghurt for dessert to reach your 5 A Day. Find out more about what counts towards your 5 A DayStarchy foods should make up just over a third of everything you eat. This means your meals should be based on these foods.Choose wholegrain or wholemeal varieties of starchy foods, such as brown rice, wholewheat pasta, and brown, wholemeal or higher fibre white bread.They contain more fibre, and usually more vitamins and minerals, than white varieties.Potatoes with the skins on are a great source of fibre and vitamins. For example, when having boiled potatoes or a jacket potato, eat the skin too.Find out more about starchy foodsMilk and dairy foods, such as cheese and yoghurt, are good sources of protein. They also contain calcium, which helps keep your bones healthy.Go for lower fat and lower sugar products where possible.Choose semi-skimmed, 1% fat or skimmed milk, as well as lower fat hard cheeses or cottage cheese, and lower fat, lower sugar yoghurt.Dairy alternatives, such as soya drinks, are also included in this food group.When buying alternatives, choose unsweetened, calcium-fortified versions.Find out more about milk and dairy foodsThese foods are all good sources of protein, which is essential for the body to grow and repair itself.They're also good sources of a range of vitamins and minerals.Meat is a good source of protein, vitamins and minerals, including iron, zinc and B vitamins. It's also one of the main sources of vitamin B12.Choose lean cuts of meat and skinless poultry whenever possible to cut down on fat. Always cook meat thoroughly.Try to eat less red and processed meat like bacon, ham and sausages.Find out more about including meat in your dietEggs and fish are also good sources of protein, and contain many vitamins and minerals. Oily fish is particularly rich in omega-3 fatty acids.Aim to eat at least 2 portions of fish a week, including 1 portion of oily fish.You can choose from fresh, frozen or canned, but remember that canned and smoked fish can often be high in salt.Pulses, including beans, peas and lentils, are naturally very low in fat and high in fibre, protein, vitamins and minerals.Nuts are high in fibre, and unsalted nuts make a good snack. But they do still contain high levels of fat, so eat them in moderation.Some fat in the diet is essential, but on average people in the UK eat too much saturated fat.It's important to get most of your fat from unsaturated oils and spreads.Swapping to unsaturated fats can help lower cholesterol.Remember that all types of fat are high in energy and should be eaten in small amounts.Find out more about the different types of fatsToo much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of developing heart disease.Regularly consuming foods and drinks high in sugar increases your risk of obesity and tooth decay.Eating too much salt can raise your blood pressure, which increases your risk of getting heart disease or having a stroke.See 8 tips for healthy eating to find out more about why you need to cut down on saturated fat, sugar and salt, which foods they're found in, and how to make healthier choices.Find out more about how to eat less saturated fatMost adults in England are overweight or obese.

Read on to learn about the factors impacting water needs, how much, how often, and how to know if you’re on target.The "eight glasses of water a day" or "drink half your body weight in water" ideas may or may not
    be best suited for you. Several factors contribute to determining how much fluid you should consume, such as:Although we can survive for weeks without food, we cannot survive for more than a few days without water. Body water
    allows us to regulate our core temperature to avoid getting too hot or too cold. Body water is also critical for
    many body processes, including:Review these 2 methods of estimating daily water needs and use what works best for you. This estimation of daily water needs is based on adequate intake (AI) for total daily water, which includes drinking
    water, beverages, and food, and is based on median total water intakes. These amounts are not a daily target but a
    general guide.The calculation method figures your daily fluid needs based on your calorie intake. You'll want to get in one
    milliliter (ml) of water for every one calorie you consume. For example, perhaps your weight maintenance calorie
    target is 2,200 calories/day. Then, your water intake (from both food and liquid sources) should be approximately
    2,200 ml/day (just over two quarts). 
Remember:
Your fluid goal is higher if you exercise for a long duration in a hot environment. And, of course, if you are
    thirsty, listen to your body! Don't stop drinking water just because you met your hydration target for the day. All non-alcoholic beverages count towards your daily water requirement, including coffee, tea, juice, and milk. Limit
    sugar-sweetened beverages to help manage your weight and maintain healthy overall dietary patterns. Tracking your water intake per day helps you see where you stand compared to your goals. If you are curious about
    where you stand regarding hydration, consider tracking your consumption. When you know (through tracking) that you're getting enough water, you realize what experts already know–water
    helps you feel energized, helps your skin appear more youthful, and can help you feel full without adding extra
    calories.The MyNetDiary app makes it easy to track hydration. The Water Tracker
    feature is available on iPhone, Android, and web apps. You can access it directly from your dashboard. Just look for
    the water glass icon.Unless you specify otherwise, the app's default glass size is eight fluid ounces (237 ml). For example, if you drink
    a cup of tea, tap one glass icon. Also, the Water Tracker feature allows you to customize how much you should drink each day and displays a graph to
    easily monitor how you're doing (see below).

Note: When you sync MyNetDiary with the iOS Health app, the total volume of water comes from the sum of all
        filled water glass icons.
Check out the various options under "Water Settings." If you tend to forget to drink water, MyNetDiary covers that, too! Simply enable Water Reminders under "Settings"
    in the Water dashboard. Plus, you can schedule the frequency and time range of reminders for further customization
    (see below).

If you are dehydrated, then start drinking! You might find it easier to tolerate drinking smaller volumes of water
    every 15 minutes or so rather than trying to guzzle a massive volume of water all at once. Then, see what you can
    learn from this experience to recalculate how much you should drink to prevent dehydration from happening
    again. If you replace a caloric beverage with water, then you will consume fewer calories. This could help you lose weight
    gradually, even if you change nothing else in your diet. Suppose you stop drinking one 20-ounce (591 ml) bottle of
    root beer and replace it
    with 20 fluid ounces (591 ml) of water. Savings = 250 calories per day = 1750 calories per week = 7500 calories per
    month = two pounds per month!Even if you simply add water to your daily intake, you might benefit from enhanced weight loss if drinking water
    prevents you from overeating.

You know fats are high in calories, but did you know there are 4 major types of fats, and some you really need? Learn how to customize your targets and make the wisest choices. MyNetDiary's default goal is 35% of calories from total fat. Fats give us more than just taste and satisfaction. Fats provide essential fatty acids necessary for health and allow us to absorb the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. This article examines the 4 major types of fat:  saturated, trans fats, unsaturated, and monounsaturated. When we refer to "total fat," we mean the sum of all 4 of these. Read on to learn more about the differences, their necessity, and impact on our well-being.  Like carbs and protein, fat is a macronutrient ("macro"). Fat provides 9 calories per gram, compared to 4 calories per gram of carbs or protein.  Many of our users are trying to lose weight and/or manage blood sugar. Therefore MyNetDiary uses default macro goals to encourage healthy proteins and fats while controlling carb intake. The goals are within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range developed by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. These ranges allow for consumption of essential nutrients, like fats, while limiting chronic disease risk.Tip: If you follow a plan that requires a different macronutrient distribution, customize your goals with a Premium membership.All fats and oils contain a mixture of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats, but each differ in proportion. For instance, olive oil is mostly monounsaturated fat, whereas coconut oil is mainly saturated fat. We break it down for you below.MyNetDiary's default goal for saturated fat is 10% of calories or less. If you have diabetes or are at increased risk for heart disease, your healthcare provider's recommendation may be lower.Saturated fats typically solidify at room temperature. Although saturated fats are mostly found in meat and dairy foods, they appear in such tropical fats as coconut oil, palm kernel oil, and palm oil. Another source of saturated fat is fully hydrogenated vegetable oil, often used to substitute for partially hydrogenated vegetable oils. You do not need to eliminate all sources of saturated fat from your diet for better heart-health. That would be impossible if you eat any fat-containing foods at all!  However, current guidelines emphasize a shift to consuming more unsaturated fats (polyunsaturated and monounsaturated) relative to saturated fats. This shift helps reduce LDL blood cholesterol and risk for heart disease. To learn the science behind saturated fat guidelines, read Dietary Fats and Cardiovascular Disease: A Presidential Advisory from the American Heart Association.  Suppose you follow an eating plan higher in saturated fat, such as a low-carb or keto diet? In that case, ask your healthcare provider if you should monitor your blood cholesterol level on one of these diets. If you have specific questions about fat consumption targets, ask your healthcare provider for guidance.
MyNetDiary's goal for trans fat is 0% of calories. It is consistent with recommendations from the American Heart Association and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
Trans fats are the most harmful for heart health, increasing blood LDL ("bad") cholesterol associated with heart disease risk.Though naturally occurring trans fats are found in small amounts in meat and dairy foods, foods made with partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs) are the biggest source of trans fats. Before becoming banned by the FDA ban, PHOs were common in restaurant food, vegetable shortening, deep-fat fried foods, stick margarine, and packaged baked goods.Read food labels and ingredient lists to see if your foods contain PHOs or trans fat. The trans fat content will be 0 grams unless the amount is over 0.5 gram per serving. But if PHO is in the ingredient list, the product contains some trans fats.MyNetDiary Tip: View Daily Analysis for a quick view of your trans fat intake compared to your goal. You can also see which of your foods contributed the most to your intake.MyNetDiary's default goal for polyunsaturated fats is 12.5% of calories, consistent with the American Heart Association's recommendation to consume relatively more unsaturated fats than saturated fats.Polyunsaturated fats are considered heart-healthy and plentiful in vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, avocado, fish, and seafood. Oils with mostly polyunsaturated fats maintain liquid form at room temperature.Our bodies cannot manufacture linoleic acid (an omega-6 fat) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fat), so these essential fatty acids must come from the diet. Since the data on these specific fatty acids is not easily accessible from the USDA National Nutrient Database, they are not required on food labels. They are not tracked on MyNetDiary.Rich linoleic acid sources include vegetable oils (especially soybean oil), nuts, seeds, meats, and eggs. Thankfully, you'll find linoleic acid easily in many plant and animal foods. Adequate Intake (AI) determined by the Dietary Reference Intakes, depending upon age and sex, is 11-17 grams of linoleic acid.Good sources of alpha-linolenic acid include flaxseed oil and flaxseeds, chia seeds, canola oil, walnuts, walnut oil, and soybean oil. Depending upon age and sex, Adequate Intake is 1.1-1.6 grams of alpha-linolenic acid. 
You'll easily meet these essential fatty acid goals if your fat intake is not severely restricted.  
Cold-water fish, such as salmon and mackerel, are high in the heart-healthy omega-3s, DHA and EPA. There is no established recommended intake of DHA and EPA. We convert a small amount of alpha-linolenic acid to EPA and DHA. MyNetDiary's default goal for monounsaturated fat is 12.5% of calories or more. You'll find heart-healthy monounsaturated fats plentiful in olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pistachios, almonds, pecans, and peanuts. Oils with mostly monounsaturated fat also stay liquid at room temperature.Mediterranean diet means monounsaturated fat benefits! Studies have shown that people following traditional eating plans from countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea tend to have less heart disease. Mediterranean diet patterns feature extra virgin olive oil as the main oil. High in monounsaturated fat, olive oil contains polyphenols (a heart-healthy antioxidant). MyNetDiary's default macro goals are compatible with a Mediterranean-style diet. You can drizzle olive oil and other cold-pressed oils over your food or use them for baking, roasting, and sauteing. The antioxidant content is highest in unheated oil. Canola and peanut oils are also significant sources of monounsaturated fat and are good options for high-temperature cooking. Read our tips for choosing cooking oils here.

Learn about the three main types of carbohydrates and how MyNetDiary makes it easy to set custom targets and track what is important to you!Carbohydrates, or “carbs,” include three main types: starches, sugars, and fiber.
Starches and sugars, whether found in grains, fruit, milk, yogurt, or sweets, wind up as blood sugar and are used as a source of energy.
Some people choose to limit carbohydrates to promote weight loss. In addition, studies associate a diet high in refined starches and added sugars with a higher risk for cardiovascular disease. The healthiest carbohydrate sources among the three main types include unprocessed whole grains (such as oats, quinoa, and brown rice), fruit, dried beans and peas, and unsweetened milk or yogurt.  Most of our users are trying to lose weight or manage blood sugar. Therefore, MyNetDiary uses a default carbohydrate goal of 45% of calories, balanced with healthy proteins and fat. These goals are within the Institute of Medicine’s Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range. These ranges support the intake of essential nutrients while reducing chronic disease risk.  If you want a different macronutrient distribution, you can customize your goals with a Premium Membership, as shown below:Consider our Premium Low-Carb or Keto diet plans for additional carb-tracking support. 

Dietary fiber is a complex carbohydrate that humans cannot completely digest. The benefits of fiber include proper digestion, the growth of healthful gut bacteria, and feeling full. High-fiber foods such as fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains contain other valuable nutrients. 
        There are two types of fiber: insoluble and soluble. Most plant foods provide a mix of both fibers.Insoluble fiber doesn’t absorb water. This type of fiber adds bulk to the stool, helping prevent and manage constipation and supporting a healthy digestive tract. Good sources of insoluble fiber include bran from grains, and skins and seeds from fruits and vegetables.Soluble fiber absorbs water to form a gel-like consistency.  

Soluble fiber helps soften stools and lowers cholesterol. Rich sources of soluble fiber include oats, chia seeds, carrots, and legumes.  
The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for total fiber intake for adults is 14 grams per 1000 calories and is MyNetDiary's default goal. You may prefer to use these Adequate Intake (AI) goals for fiber to encourage plenty of fiber even on a lower calorie plan:If you track sugars using MyNetDiary, the value refers to total sugars, whether naturally occurring sugars (like fruit and yogurt) or added sugars (like granulated sugar, honey, and corn syrup). MyNetDiary uses a default limit of 25% of total calories for sugars.There are many forms of sugar, including lactose, fructose, and sucrose. Excess added sugars can pose a risk for heart disease, supply extra calories, and reduce nutrient quality. Of the three types of carbohydrates, added sugars can be the sneakiest to sabotage your weight-loss goals. The US Dietary Guidelines recommend no more than 10% of total calories from added sugars. For example, if you consume 2000 calories, your limit would be 200 calories (50 grams) from added sugars per day.MyNetDiary uses this target of under 10% of calories from added sugars as a default limit. Despite the name, sugar alcohols are neither sugar nor alcohol. Instead, they are a type of sweetener used in many reduced-sugar foods. Sugar alcohols are lower in calories than sugar because we don’t entirely digest them. As a result, some people experience unpleasant side effects (such as gas, bloating, and diarrhea) when consuming them in large amounts.  Net carbs refers to the fully digestible carbs found in foods. Net Carbs = Total Carbohydrate (g) minus Dietary Fiber (g) minus Sugar Alcohol (g) minus Allulose (g)Example: For a food with 28 grams total carb, 10 grams fiber, and 12 grams of sugar alcohol, Net Carb is:
    28g Total Carb
    - 10g Dietary Fiber
    - 12g Sugar Alcohol
    = 6 g Net Carb
Note: If a product does not list sugar alcohols or allulose on the label, MyNetDiary assumes this value is zero when calculating net carbs. MyNetDiary Premium allows you to set custom carb targets and track the three main types of carbohydrates and more!  You can track and customize your goal for any of the following:Simply tap My Weight Plan on your Dashboard and select the "Nutrient Targets" tab at the top. When you choose specific nutrients, you may also select "Show on Dashboard" or "Show in Log" under Target and Settings to see the nutrients more conveniently. Perhaps you're striving to lose weight or watching blood sugars for diabetes management. Either way, better understanding the three types of carbohydrates in your diet and applying these tracking tips will help you reach your healthier lifestyle.

Claims about protein are everywhere, but what are the benefits of eating protein as part of a healthy diet? Read about how protein is vital for weight loss. Learn how MyNetDiary calculates your protein needs and discover rich protein sources to add to your diet. Dietary protein is critical to health because of the amino acids or building blocks of proteins. We use amino acids for growth and development, cell generation, hormone and enzyme building, and other functions like supporting a healthy immune system! Eating protein daily is vital for ensuring health.You can meet your daily protein needs from both plant and animal foodsSome animal proteins are higher in calories because of fat. Choose lean cuts, trim excess fat, and avoid deep-fat frying to ensure you reap the benefits of protein-rich foods without the extra calories. Tip: Coldwater fish and seafood are excellent protein choices since they contain heart-healthy omega-3 fats.Plant-based proteins, such as dried beans and peas (legumes), soybeans, nuts, seeds, and grains, are tTip: Legumes support healthy gut bacteria and are blood sugar-friendly.To achieve weight-loss success, you must meet your protein needs daily. Since protein takes longer to digest than carbohydrates, you may stay full longer by eating protein at each meal.  Eating enough protein combined with a strength-training routine helps preserve muscle mass as you lose weight.More protein isn’t necessarily better and excess protein won’t increase muscle growth. You may gain weight if you exceed your calorie budget by overeating protein. Tip: Aim for at least 60g/day of protein on a reduced-calorie diet.Since many MyNetDiary members are trying to lose weight or manage blood sugar, we use a macronutrient target to encourage healthy proteins and fats while controlling carbs.MyNetDiary’s default recommendation for protein is 20% of total daily calories, within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range of 10-35% of total calories.If you prefer a different protein target, customize your goals with a Premium MyNetDiary membership, as seen below:
You can also plan your protein needs based on your body weight. The US Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram (or about .36 g per pound) daily. For example, for someone weighing 180 lbs. (82 kg), their RDA for protein is 65 grams (82 kg x 0.8 g/kg).Tip: Divide pounds by 2.2 to get kg.The modest RDA target may be too low for some. Many reduced-calorie weight-loss plans suggest 1.2-1.5 g per kg. Athletes, older adults, and those trying to build muscle may also benefit from a higher intake than the RDA. Read here for more information on starting a higher-protein plan.Those with certain kidney and liver conditions may need to limit protein intake. Follow the advice of your doctor or dietitian.The human body uses 20 amino acids, nine of which are considered “essential,” meaning they must come strictly from the diet. Animal proteins (meat, fish, poultry, game, eggs, and dairy) are “complete,” so they provide all the essential amino acids needed to build proteins. Since plant proteins are often low in one or more essential amino acids, eating a variety of plant proteins throughout the day will ensure you get enough of each essential amino acid. Athletes may pay special attention to such amino acids as leucine, isoleucine, and valine (the “branch-chained amino acids”) to help in muscle recovery and repair. You can now track amino acids with a MyNetDiary Premium membership. Healthy, protein-packed foods listed in order of the fewest calories per gram of protein:

Follow our guide to meet your nutrition needs with a balance of tasty foods.Healthy eating is so much more than calories in and calories out-the foods you choose to eat daily are essential to your health, satisfaction, and feeling your best.  Although the details vary from one eating plan to another, there are fundamental principles of healthy eating. First, focus on consuming a wide variety of foods from all food groups, paying particular attention to choosing fresh, seasonal, and less processed foods. This approach will help you get enough essential nutrients while minimizing added sodium and sugar. The chart below gives examples of daily targets for different calorie levels. A basic understanding of these targets is a perfect way to develop menus around foods for good nutrition. Of course, your targets may vary based on your food preferences and health needs. Consult a registered dietitian if you need a more personalized plan. Use the information below to learn about the nutrients provided by each food group and what counts as a serving (hint: the servings sizes are often surprisingly small). Key nutrients: Carbohydrates, fiber, folate, iron, magnesium, niacin, riboflavin, thiamin, vitamin B6, and zinc.Serving sizes:Tips:Starchy veggies like potatoes, corn, peas, and beans are included because their calorie and carbohydrate content is similar to grains. Focus on whole grains for higher fiber and better nutrition value.Key nutrients: Carbohydrates, fiber, folate, magnesium, potassium, riboflavin, vitamins A, B6, C, E, and K.Serving sizes:Tip:
Choose a variety of dark green, orange, and other colorful vegetables every day.
Key nutrients: Carbohydrates, fiber, folate, magnesium, potassium, and vitamin C.Serving sizes:Tip:

Milk and yogurt naturally contain carbohydrates. Note that we include cheese as a protein (below) because it has almost no carbohydrates.Key nutrients: Protein, iron, niacin, phosphorus, protein, vitamin B12, and zincServing sizesTips: 
Aim for two servings of fish per week for heart health.
Beans and peas provide protein, but include them as a carbohydrate source if counting carbs. 
Key nutrients: The essential fatty acids alpha-linolenic acid and  linoleic acid, omega 3s, and vitamin EServing Sizes:Tip: 
Choose primarily plant-based oils such as olive oil, avocado, nuts, and seeds for heart health.
Key nutrients: none A healthy eating plan is limited in added sugars and alcohol, yet they are not off-limits. If you follow the servings suggested for your calorie goal, you will have some "leftover" calories to spend on occasional treats. When you use a daily eating plan as your general outline for regularly consuming foods for good nutrition, your body will thank you. It may even be more resilient when met with illness, occasional overindulgence, and other bumps in your health journey.Develop a personalized nutrition plan by setting targets with MyNetDiary

Read on to learn about the factors impacting water needs, how much, how often, and how to know if you’re on target.The "eight glasses of water a day" or "drink half your body weight in water" ideas may or may not
    be best suited for you. Several factors contribute to determining how much fluid you should consume, such as:Although we can survive for weeks without food, we cannot survive for more than a few days without water. Body water
    allows us to regulate our core temperature to avoid getting too hot or too cold. Body water is also critical for
    many body processes, including:Review these 2 methods of estimating daily water needs and use what works best for you. This estimation of daily water needs is based on adequate intake (AI) for total daily water, which includes drinking
    water, beverages, and food, and is based on median total water intakes. These amounts are not a daily target but a
    general guide.The calculation method figures your daily fluid needs based on your calorie intake. You'll want to get in one
    milliliter (ml) of water for every one calorie you consume. For example, perhaps your weight maintenance calorie
    target is 2,200 calories/day. Then, your water intake (from both food and liquid sources) should be approximately
    2,200 ml/day (just over two quarts). 
Remember:
Your fluid goal is higher if you exercise for a long duration in a hot environment. And, of course, if you are
    thirsty, listen to your body! Don't stop drinking water just because you met your hydration target for the day. All non-alcoholic beverages count towards your daily water requirement, including coffee, tea, juice, and milk. Limit
    sugar-sweetened beverages to help manage your weight and maintain healthy overall dietary patterns. Tracking your water intake per day helps you see where you stand compared to your goals. If you are curious about
    where you stand regarding hydration, consider tracking your consumption. When you know (through tracking) that you're getting enough water, you realize what experts already know–water
    helps you feel energized, helps your skin appear more youthful, and can help you feel full without adding extra
    calories.The MyNetDiary app makes it easy to track hydration. The Water Tracker
    feature is available on iPhone, Android, and web apps. You can access it directly from your dashboard. Just look for
    the water glass icon.Unless you specify otherwise, the app's default glass size is eight fluid ounces (237 ml). For example, if you drink
    a cup of tea, tap one glass icon. Also, the Water Tracker feature allows you to customize how much you should drink each day and displays a graph to
    easily monitor how you're doing (see below).

Note: When you sync MyNetDiary with the iOS Health app, the total volume of water comes from the sum of all
        filled water glass icons.
Check out the various options under "Water Settings." If you tend to forget to drink water, MyNetDiary covers that, too! Simply enable Water Reminders under "Settings"
    in the Water dashboard. Plus, you can schedule the frequency and time range of reminders for further customization
    (see below).

If you are dehydrated, then start drinking! You might find it easier to tolerate drinking smaller volumes of water
    every 15 minutes or so rather than trying to guzzle a massive volume of water all at once. Then, see what you can
    learn from this experience to recalculate how much you should drink to prevent dehydration from happening
    again. If you replace a caloric beverage with water, then you will consume fewer calories. This could help you lose weight
    gradually, even if you change nothing else in your diet. Suppose you stop drinking one 20-ounce (591 ml) bottle of
    root beer and replace it
    with 20 fluid ounces (591 ml) of water. Savings = 250 calories per day = 1750 calories per week = 7500 calories per
    month = two pounds per month!Even if you simply add water to your daily intake, you might benefit from enhanced weight loss if drinking water
    prevents you from overeating.

According to the CDC, nearly three-fourths of us are overweight or obese. Yet more than 160 million Americans are on a diet at any given time, and we drop more than $70 billion each year on commercial weight-loss plans, supplements, and other pound-shedding measures. That suggests that losing weight is not easy — yet it is entirely possible when done right. There are two keys to success when it comes to weight loss. The first is to find an approach that works for you specifically, one that makes you feel good and keeps you motivated. The second is to take your time; sustainable weight loss happens slowly but steadily.Before you set out on your effort, make sure you know exactly what you're trying to achieve. Ask yourself, "How much weight do I need to lose to be healthy?" Then set personalized goals in achievable increments, and introduce lifestyle changes to gradually lose weight and keep it off. Be prepared to adapt your lifestyle as necessary to maximize your chances of success.On this page you'll discoverIt's a question on the minds of most people once they've decided they need to shed some pounds: what is the best diet for weight loss? While that's not an unreasonable question, it often implies an approach that is less than optimal, which is to plan on adopting a radically restrictive mode of eating for a while until the weight is lost, and then going back to eating as normal. Instead of embracing fad diets, people who have lost weight — and kept it off — usually have made a permanent shift toward healthier eating habits. Simply replacing unhealthy foods with healthy ones — not for a few weeks, but forever — will help you achieve weight loss while also offering numerous other benefits. So a better set of questions might be, "What is a healthy diet? What does a healthy diet look like?"A healthy diet favors natural, unprocessed foods over prepackaged meals and snacks. It is balanced, meaning that it provides your body with all the nutrients and minerals it needs to function best. It emphasizes plant-based foods, especially fruits and vegetables, over animal foods. It contains plenty of protein. It is low in sugar and salt. It incorporates healthy fats including fish, olive oil, and other plant-derived oils.Here are a few examples of healthy meals for weight loss. For breakfast, a bowl of bran flakes with sliced strawberries and walnuts with nonfat milk. For lunch, a turkey sandwich on wheat with vegetables and an olive oil and vinegar dressing. For dinner, a salmon steak on a bed of spinach.You don't have to cut out snacks in order to eat a healthy diet, either. Healthy snacks for weight loss include almonds or pistachios, string cheese with an apple, Greek yogurt, or a banana with peanut butter.Before you begin your weight-loss journey, do some brainstorming about the kinds of healthy foods you enjoy so that you can have lots of choices as you plan your meals and snacks. Remember that the best diet is the one you'll stick to, so don't rush out and buy a bunch of "health foods" that you know you'll never eat.There is no single diet that nutritionists have deemed "the healthiest." However, there are several styles of eating that experts either have designed for optimal health or have observed to be healthy when consumed traditionally by different people around the world. Such styles of eating tend to have a few things in common: they tend to be plant-based diets; they emphasize healthy fats, no simple sugars, and low sodium; and they favor natural foods over the highly processed fare typical of much of the Western diet.For example, the Mediterranean-style diet gets its name from the foods available to various cultures located around the Mediterranean Sea. It heavily emphasizes minimally processed fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and whole grains. It contains moderate amounts of yogurt, cheese, poultry, and fish. Olive oil is its primary cooking fat. Red meat and foods with added sugars are only eaten sparingly. Besides being an effective weight loss method, eating a Mediterranean-style diet is linked to a lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, depression, and some forms of cancer.Experts developed the DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) specifically as a heart-healthy regimen. The combination of food types contained in the diet seem to work together especially effectively to lower blood pressure and decrease risk of heart failure. The key features of DASH are low cholesterol and saturated fats; lots of magnesium, calcium, fiber, and potassium; and little to no red meat and sugar. Unsurprisingly, that equates to a list of foods similar to those of the Mediterranean diet: whole grains, vegetables, fruits, fish, poultry, nuts, and olive oil.As its name implies, the MIND diet (Mediterranean-DASH diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) was designed by doctors to take elements from the Mediterranean and DASH diets that seemed to provide benefits to brain health and stave off dementia and cognitive decline. In practice, it is very similar to both the Mediterranean and DASH diets, but it puts stronger emphasis on leafy green vegetables and berries, and less emphasis on fruit and dairy.In recent years, the Nordic diet has emerged as both a weight-loss and health-maintenance diet. Based on Scandinavian eating patterns, the Nordic diet is heavy on fish, apples, pears, whole grains such as rye and oats, and cold-climate vegetables including cabbage, carrots, and cauliflower. Studies have supported its use both in preventing stroke and in weight loss.What do all of these diets have in common? They're all good for your heart, they all consist of natural unprocessed foods, and they all contain plenty of plant-based dishes. Eating for your health — especially your heart health — by adopting elements from these diets is a smart way to lose weight.You've probably heard some inspiring success stories about intermittent fasting. But is fasting healthy, and does intermittent fasting work?Fasting — abstaining from eating for some period of time — is an ancient practice that is safe when not taken to extremes. Traditionally, the benefits of fasting have been both spiritual and physical. People who fast for religious reasons often report a stronger focus on spiritual matters during the fast. Physically, a simple fast lowers blood sugar, reduces inflammation, improves metabolism, clears out toxins from damaged cells, and has been linked to lower risk of cancer, reduced pain from arthritis, and enhanced brain function.Intermittent fasting means dividing one's time between "eating windows" and periods of abstention on a regular basis. A common intermittent fasting schedule might restrict eating to the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., with the remaining 16 hours of the day spent fasting. But there is no specific, prescribed schedule. Some people have more or less generous eating windows, setting the rule that they will not eat after, say, 8:00 p.m. — or, on the considerably less generous side, only allowing themselves to eat every other day.The science behind intermittent fasting is based on altering the body's metabolism. During a period without eating, insulin levels drop to the point that the body begins burning fat for fuel. Additionally, the thinking goes, by slowing the body's metabolism, you cause your appetite to drop off and thus will consume fewer calories when you resume eating.Numerous studies have demonstrated the benefits of intermittent fasting for weight loss. However, it's not clear that it is any more effective than simply restricting calories and following a normal eating schedule. One possible reason for the success of intermittent fasting is that most practitioners have quit the habit of eating during the late evening and night hours. Restricting eating to earlier in the day aligns better with our bodies' circadian rhythms, and is less likely to cause us to store our food in fat cells. Since intermittent fasting is difficult for many people to adhere to, a wise alternative might be to consume a low-calorie Mediterranean diet and to stop the day's eating in late afternoon.There are certain people who should not try intermittent fasting without first checking with their doctor, such those with diabetes or heart disease.Intermittent fasting is a very lifestyle-intensive dietary pattern, meaning that it is challenging to maintain in the face of normal social relationships. If the rest of your family is eating while you're fasting, you might be tempted to indulge or to surrender to the family-meal ritual. If your job requires you to dine with clients or colleagues, you'll find an intermittent fasting schedule difficult to maintain. Remember that the best healthy eating plan is the one you'll stick to.It sounds counterintuitive, but many people find success losing weight, especially initially, by eating more fat, not less. Called a ketogenic or Keto diet, this method requires shifting the main source of calories over to fatty foods — between 75% and 90% of what you eat, with only 10% to 20% of your calories coming from protein and a mere 5% from carbohydrates. The theory is that by eating so many healthy fats and restricting carbohydrates, you enter an altered metabolic state in which you force your body to begin relying on fat for energy, burning away your fat stores instead of sugar for fuel.Research does show that keto is an effective way to jump-start weight loss and improve blood-sugar levels. However, it is hard to maintain, and to date we are lacking long-term studies that show it to be a sustainable eating pattern for keeping weight off.Because both weight loss and overall health are tied to some basic eating patterns, we have developed the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate as a model for meal planning and for your overall balanced diet. Imagine a round dinner plate with a line running vertically down its center dividing it evenly in two. One half of the plate should be taken up by equal portions of whole grains (not refined grains like white bread and white rice) and healthy protesuch as fish, nuts, beans, and poultry (not red meat or processed meats). Two-thirds of the other half should be filled with vegetables, with the remaining portion consisting of fruit. Try to inject a lot of variety into this half of your plate (or half of your diet): eat fruits in a variety of colors and vegetables of all types (but don't count potatoes or French fries as vegetables).To one side of the plate, picture a glass of water, since that's the best drink for weight loss and for overall health (at some meals you can substitute coffee or tea with little to no sugar). Don't drink more than a serving or two of milk each day.To the other side of the plate, imagine a vessel containing healthy oils such as canola or olive oil. Use it for cooking or at the table instead of butter.Remember the Healthy Eating Plate when you're contemplating what to eat for a specific meal, when you're grocery shopping, or when you're strategizing about how to lose weight and keep it off. Adhering to its guidelines will optimize your chances of remaining healthy and of maintaining a desirable body weight.Some adults may need a measles booster shot.

So let’s take a look at the problem.Okay, so you’re a person who doesn’t like the taste of vegetables, and everyone from your mother to nutrition experts are telling you to eat more.We cannot gloss over the fact that most of us should eat more vegetables. Regular consumption of vegetables brings with it a number of health benefits. This is indisputable.We understand that the taste of some vegetables on their own, without sauces, dressings and condiments, can leave a good deal to be desired in the taste department.But there are ways in which you can incorporate more vegetables into your diet, without having to bite into a bland-tasting cauliflower piece on the one hand, and drenching it with some processed and fattening sauce on the other. A happy medium exists. We assure you.And no, you certainly don’t have to be a master in the kitchen to do so either. Hummus to the rescue. The Middle-Eastern dip made from chickpeas, sesame paste, garlic and olive oil can be spread on bread, eaten with chips (well, healthy versions, of course) or simply eaten with a variety of vegetables to improve their taste.And that’s the goal, isn’t it?For those who discriminate against eating vegetables on their own, or those who feel like most vegetables are just missing something, hummus is a healthy way to add some flavour.It’s healthy and tasty—both good reasons on their own. Being high in protein, it helps you feel full for longer as protein takes longer to digest. Amongst its many benefits, you will find that hummus contains manganese, iron, fibre and Vitamin C, underscores our Montreal dietitian.Discover more about the nutritional benefits of hummus.Beware to not overindulge in this healthy and delicious dip as it is rather high in carbohydrates and fat. So use it sparingly if you’re watching your carb intake or when trying to lose a few pounds.Just because it teems with health benefits, don’t double-dip every broccoli piece in it or use the carrot stick as a hummus shovel.It’s important to remember that even healthy foods may have some drawbacks. One thing is certain though: hummus improves the taste of just about everything. And because it does, you’re likely to eat more vegetables. Many people already steam vegetables, so the next step should be seamless. While eating steamed vegetables on their own is always a good idea, largely because steaming cooks the vegetables while retaining much of the nutrient content, some people just find them plain-tasting. And, at times, they can be.Here’s what you can do to improve their taste.Instead of having these steamed vegetables as a side, add them to rice or *quinoa dishes, along with a nice teriyaki sauce as the icing on the proverbial cake.Doing so can serve a dual function.i) You will likely eat more of those bland vegetables if their taste is enhanced by teriyaki sauce.ii) Chances are, you will eat less of the carbohydrate-heavy rice. When you add vegetables to the dish, you will effectively make the portion appear larger. In other words, there is no visual deprivation or the feeling that you’re eating less food, which can be challenging for some. Applying this strategy can help those who tend to consume portions of carbohydrates that are too large.*Quinoa, itself, is brimming with health benefits. It’s great for those with allergies, gluten-free, rich in amino acids, high in protein, while having a low glycemic index. Next on ‘let’s-introduce-more-vegetables-to-your-diet’ menu is a remedy for those who just don’t like salads, at least without salad dressing.Here’s a simple steps to jump the leafy greens hump.a) Start with leafy greens as your base.b) Then, add a freshly-cooked, sliced chicken breast.c) Toss in some sliced sweet potatoes to the mix.d) Use a bowl of generous size and proportion these right. For example, 50% of the bowl comprises greens, 20% sweet potatoes and the rest, that’s 30%, chicken.e) As dressing, add a dash of extra-virgin olive oil and apple-cider or balsamic vinegar.Why add these ingredients?If you don’t like the taste of greens such as lettuce, spinach or kale, you are more likely to eat them if mixed with the sweetness of the sweet potatoes and the meaty texture of the chicken. The potatoes and the chicken will boost the flavour. This is especially important for people who tend to skip salads.Chicken is a healthy, high and lean protein source, which forms an integral part of a nutritionally balanced diet.Sweet potatoes, on the other hand, have a lower glycemic index than many other carbs. They are also packed with fibre, Vitamins A and C, as well as manganese. In our experience, many of our clients who seek a dietitian for weight loss tend to consume carbohydrates such as pasta in portions that are often too large. That’s one of the first things we typically notice.There is, however, a simple and effective way of reducing pasta portions while increasing vegetable intake. Simply cook or steam your favourite vegetables, chop them up into bite-sized pieces and then add them to your pasta.You can take this a step further and place the cooked or steamed vegetables on the plate first, then add pasta.If a good part of the plate is filled with vegetables, then it’s likely that less pasta will be added, effectively leading to the consumption of a smaller portion of pasta. The plate will still appear full of food, once again tricking your brain into thinking your portion size has remained unchanged.Give this method a shot because it often works wonders. Zoodles are tasty and can also act as a pasta replacement.To make zoodles, spiralize green and yellow zucchini to mimic pasta.You can add tomato sauce, olive oil and other vegetables to give the zoodles more flavour.Twirl with a fork and eat it like regular pasta.How to make and cook zucchini noodles.If you’re not ready to completely give up your beloved pasta, mix zoodles with regular pasta. Perhaps try more of the former and less of the latter. If not, do a 50-50. Whatever you decide to do, you’ll be eating more vegetables.Spaghetti squash or other veggie spirals can work in a similar way. Utilizing an air fryer has become quite popular in recent years, and for a well-deserved reason: healthier cooking.One of the primary reasons why so many people air fry their food is the use of little to no cooking oil. As a result, you consume less fat if you air fry. What’s more, using an air fryer cuts calories by 70-80%, according to WebMD.So what vegetables can you air fry?You have a great deal of room to get creative here. We suggest you try air frying your favourite vegetables.Simply slice them up, set the timer and let the fryer do the work. Easy work for great tasting, healthier food–and an easy way to add more vegetables to your diet. A good way to cut the carbs and add vegetables at the same time can be accomplished with simulated rice such as cauliflower rice.Essentially, all you have to do is grate the florets by hand or use a food processor, and you have your bed of simulated rice.To add flavour to your cauli-rice, sauté the cauliflower in olive oil with some garlic and onions. The cauliflower rice can also be used in various stir-fry recipes.Related: Everything You Need To Know About Cauliflower To up your intake of vegetables, you can also turn to bean sprouts. According to Healthline, bean sprouts are high in Vitamin K, fibre and choline. They are also low in calories, which is naturally conducive to weight maintenance and weight loss.Related: Why Am I Not Losing Weight?Why You Should Work with a Weight Loss CoachBean sprouts can be added to your stir fry or, as suggested, along with cauliflower rice, act as a bed of rice. You can simply place the cooked chicken and vegetables right over the sprouts for a healthy, low-carbohydrate meal. Lettwich?Yes, lettuce-sandwich, a.k.a. lettwich.In essence, this entails wrapping your desired protein source (lean turkey or chicken) and other sandwich contents with a larger lettuce leaf instead of bread.While adding more vegetables to your daily consumption, you can also reducing your bread intake, if that happens to be your goal.If you’re not too fond of lettuce, try using a cabbage leaf instead, making it a cabbwich.Again, if you’re not ready to do away with bread altogether, use a slice of bread as the bottom of the sandwich while adding a lettuce or cabbage leaf to the top. Just beware that cabbage is one of those foods that are difficult to digest, at least for some. Another great way to introduce more vegetables into your meals can be achieved by adding mushrooms, zucchini, spinach or peppers to an omelet.Not only will doing so add texture and flavour to your eggs, it will provide valuable nutrients and vitamins, explained our Winnipeg dietitian. It’s quick and easy. The beauty of a smoothie rests with its versatility.It can be downed for breakfast, as a snack or as a pre- or post-workout fuelling drink, suggest our sports nutritionists.Adding vegetables such as spinach or baby kale to a smoothie is simple without altering the taste of the smoothie itself too much. In order to speed up the process, buy the mentioned greens pre-washed.Consume these daily and you will eat more vegetables. It’s just that simple. A scoop of a green supplement mixed with a glass of water can swiftly add about 5-6 servings of vegetables to your daily consumption.In addition, many of these greens carry numerous nutrients, vitamins and minerals needed by our bodies. Although a healthy and lean protein, plain chicken is considered by some to be an unadventurous culinary experience.There are, however, many ways to change this with spices, rubs and sauces.Equally effective at improving the taste of the plain old chicken are vegetables.But we’re not alluding to vegetables as a side. Instead, we propose filling the chicken breast with vegetables.To do this mix vegetables (lettuce, onions, tomatoes, anything) in a bowl with a sauce or a little melted cheese. Then, prior to baking the chicken breast, make an incision to create a small pocket. Fill those pockets with the vegetable mix and bake your chicken.According to our Vancouver dietitian, Paulina, this is a simple and delicious way to eat more vegetables and make the humdrum chicken something special. Perhaps not the most healthy suggestion on the list, but one that can be considered from time to time, if you’re trying to add more vegetables to your diet.Many people use fruit, when baking treats and desserts such as muffins.Another option you could take is using vegetables rather than fruit. It does sound odd, but it can work in some cases.You could mix fruit and vegetables, or even go all in, and use vegetables only.Carrots, zucchini, squash or golden beets can all work in baked desserts.As mentioned before, carrots are great for your eyes and contain antioxidants. Squash, on the other hand, is high in fibre and benefits digestion. Meanwhile, beets contain folate and manganese, which are good for heart and bone health, respectively.You can even use golden beets, since they are known to be the sweeter counterpart, so probably a better option for desserts.No matter, these are the more creative ways of introducing vegetables to your diet.Related: 11 Dessert Recipes with Hidden Vegetables Perhaps not the most creative way you can add vegetables to your diet, it is a highly effective one nonetheless.Soups are typically nutritious in and of themselves.You can build on this by increasing the amount of vegetables in your favourite soups. You can even resort to a soup made entirely of vegetables.If you feel vegetable soups are on the bland side, simply introduce herbs and spices. Because there are so many vegetables out there, you have much room for experimentation.In addition, each vegetable provides a unique taste and texture, working well in combination with other vegetables.What’s more, each vegetable brings something to the table in terms of nutritional value. Tomatoes are good for the heart, carrots for the eyes, and leeks for digestion, to name a few examples.Because most cuisines around the world have soups that are endemic to a particular culture or region, you have endless options before you, so boredom should not be a concern.Related: 30 Vegetable Soups You’ll Want To Make Forever Porridge or oatmeal are great choices for a filling breakfast.Adding in vegetables is a wonderful idea if you’re looking for a more hearty morning meal.The taste of porridge and oatmeal can be strong, so if you aren’t a huge fan of how vegetables taste but need to get them in, this might just be the perfect way. Many vegetables are a very good source of fibre, so by adding them in, you’ll be full for longer.Related: Oats and Porridge Vegetable Recipe For extra flavour, people often grate cheese onto their food.Instead of cheese, why not garnish your desired meal with grated vegetables.Carrots, zucchinis, celery, radish, cucumber are some examples that can be grated easily. Grated vegetables can introduce some healthy nutritious crunch to just about any meal.In addition, the taste will be more subtle, since the vegetables will be finely cut. A perfect opportunity to add more vegetables to your diet presents itself during the barbecue season.Making vegetable-only shish-kabobs or skewers can be a tasty accompaniment to any barbecue made meal. This is another simple way to eat more vegetables. Simply replace some or all of the rice and meat from the contents of stuffed peppers with vegetables.It’s good to experiment here to see which vegetable stuffing works for you and your taste buds. These days many people have heard of kale chips on account of their popularity. But there are other vegetables that can made into chips. Equally effective in this form are beets, Brussels sprouts, broccoli and zucchini. Who says meat and cheese have to be the primary or only ingredients in a quesadilla?We highly recommend sneaking in some vegetables into this famous Mexican dish. A number of vegetables can work well here: broccoli, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes, onions, corn and much more. Pizza crusts are no longer made only from flour, like many of us remember. These days vegetable pizza crusts are becoming more and more popular. Cauliflower pizza crust is probably at the top of the list. Other vegetable pizza crusts are also available: zucchini, carrot, beet root, squash, broccoli and spinach.Find your favourite and you have yet another way to eat more vegetables. In the end, these are just some of the ways you can start to eat more vegetables. Many more exist. If you have any other unique ways that you feel should be added to the list, feel free to share it with us.The important thing to remember is to find ways to incorporate vegetables into your diet that you enjoy, that are convenient and that work specifically for you.All you have to do now is plan and prep meals that incorporate some or all of these strategies. All the best.If you require assistance in this area, contact us or book a free consultation. Other Popular Posts:How to Create a Healthy Food EnvironmentWhy Is Drinking Water Important and How Much Water Should You Drink?How To Meal Prep: 32 Meal Prepping Tips &amp; StrategiesDo Meal Plans Work?

They also examine the basic differences between different types of sugar, helping to answer the question: Is all sugar the same?Is all sugar the same?In short, no. Not all sugar is the same.Let’s take a closer look as to why all sugar isn’t the same.Undoubtedly, sugar is a food that is frequently consumed, yet often misunderstood.Sugar is found in a myriad of food products available to us in grocery stores, under a multitude of names. There are many common names or sources of sugar. These include: honey, maple syrup, fruit, table sugar, brown sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and so on.Here is a complete list of all of the names of sugar: What Are the Different Types of Sugar? Added and Natural Sugars.Sugar’s wide availability raises many questions about the differences between each sugar’s name, and consequently, its effect on the body.Additionally, contradicting information readily available online makes it hard to understand how sugar really affects us.This, in turn, raises the question “Is all sugar the same?”To answer this question, we must go back to sugar 101: the basics of sugar. Sugar is the umbrella name given to a broad category of carbohydrate compounds (White, 2018). Frequently, sugar is used as a sweetening enhancement in food. That said, it can also have some nutritional benefits, when eaten from the right sources and in moderate amounts (White, 2018).Most sugars are naturally occurring substances in the environment (White, 2018). For example, sugar can be found in carbohydrate-rich foods such as bread, which the body transforms into glucose. In turn, glucose is required to sustain life.Sugar can also be found in products such as maple syrup, sugar cane (table sugar) and beetroot (brown sugar) in the form of sucrose, glucose and fructose in varying amounts. Food items such as fruit and honey contain fructose (White, 2018).In addition, there are sugars that are processed or chemically refined. This means that the natural sugar source is processed for the purpose of purification until only the sugar remains (White, 2018). This is often done to cane sugar which, when processed, becomes the white table sugar found in stores. Corn can also undergo this process to create high fructose corn syrup.Furthermore, a common nutrition myth is that maple syrup is a more natural source of sugar. However, maple syrup undergoes a lengthy process to become the final product from the sap collected from trees. This process can make the sugar more concentrated. As such, it may not be beneficial to consume in high amounts.When sugars undergo this process, they become easier to use in cooking, baking, or other food production (White, 2018). Hence the reason the majority of the foods available contain refined sugars.The different types of sugar normally undergo different metabolic pathways. However, they all are ultimately used for the same purpose: energy (Nakrani et al., 2020).No Sugar 101 list would be complete without outlining the different types of sugar that exist. Let’s take a look.Glucose is a simple sugar that is essential for fuel and energy for the body. Essentially, glucose is the end result of carbohydrate consumption. It is a precursor for multiple other processes within the body. Ultimately, glucose is used to fuel the brain and other body parts (Nakrani et al., 2020).When we eat food, there is an automatic process in the digestive system where starches, sugars, and fibres are broken down to extract glucose. This glucose is then released into the bloodstream, and has a blood glucose-raising effect. That is, it increases the blood levels of sugar.At this point, the pancreas signals the release of insulin, which allows for the body to move glucose into the cells where it is used as energy.After a period of fasting, which can last as little as 1-2 hours, our blood glucose levels decline, signalling that it is time for another meal (Nakrani et al., 2020).Carbohydrates are one of the 3 major macronutrients that are essential for maintaining good health and keeping the body well fed. Carbohydrates turn into glucose in the body.Therefore, eating carbohydrates such as whole grain breads, potatoes, vegetables and fruit are desirable sources of glucose. They fuel the body with glucose which is needed for energy while also providing the body with fibre, vitamins, and minerals (White, 2018). Fructose is a fruit sugar or natural sugar. It often comes from consuming whole fruits or honey (White, 2018). However, fructose is also a component of high fructose corn syrup. But more on that a little later.In the body, a small amount of fructose gets converted into glucose by the liver. The liver can either release glucose into the bloodstream to be used, or send it to the muscles in the body to be used as an energy store (University of California San Francisco, 2016). A larger amount of the fructose consumed becomes stored as fat and remains in the liver (Laughlin, 2014).Fruits contain added nutrients such as vitamins or minerals, and also contain fibre which add to the benefits of consuming them (White, 2018).What’s more, fructose has a slow absorption rate due to the fibre found in fruits. This means that, when consumed, fructose gradually increases blood glucose levels as opposed to other sources of sugar (University of California San Francisco, 2016). Consequently, this means that there is less of a chance of a quick blood sugar spike, which if happens often, can lead to disease (Bantle, 2009).As alluded to before, high fructose corn syrup is another form of fructose that is commonly found in sugary foods.Over the years, high fructose corn syrup has developed a bad reputation.But what is so bad about it?When processed, high fructose corn syrup becomes highly concentrated in its sugar content. This makes it very sweet. It also makes it easy to include in foods.What’s more, it is lacking in other nutrients that add to its nutritional benefit. As a majority of the fructose consumed becomes stored as fat, a high consumption of high fructose corn syrup can cause an excessive amount of fat to accumulate in the body. As a result, this can lead to chronic disease such as obesity or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Jensen et al., 2018). Sucrose is a sugar composed of glucose and fructose, as per Healthline.Sucrose is also absorbed mainly in the large intestine (Gibson et al., 2013). An enzyme that specializes in sucrose breakdown breaks down sucrose into its two pieces: fructose and glucose (Gibson et al., 2013).The sugars are then taken to the bloodstream, in which they can either be absorbed into the cells or be stored for later use in the muscles and liver as glycogen, or by being converted into fat (Gibson et al., 2013).Moreover, sucrose is often found in common, high-sugar foods such as candy, chocolates, ice cream, jams, juices, and sugar sweetened beverages (Acton et al., 2017).In addition, sugar can be found in products such as condiments, or frozen and ready-made meals (Acton et al., 2017). Most refined sugars are sources of sucrose. We would be remiss if we didn’t mention the connection of sugar and chronic disease in a Sugar 101 post.In all cases, a high consumption of refined sugar is not healthy. Generally speaking, this is common knowledge.It can no doubt lead to many diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, insulin resistance, dental caries, heart disease, and bowel disorders (Alam et al., 2022).Related: Registered dietitians for diabetesRefined sugar contains a high concentration of sugar as a result of the purification process  (White, 2018). It is also found in many of the products available for us to eat, in very high amounts. Ultimately, this can increase the susceptibility of us developing diseases (White, 2018).Furthermore, the increased susceptibility of developing these disease when consuming a diet high in sugar can cause a good deal of uncertainty. It is very difficult to live a life without consuming sugar as it is essential for life, and found in many food products.Therefore, learning how and when to consume sugar in appropriate amounts is essential for maintaining health while enjoying delicious food.Learning that sugary foods such as sweets or beverages can be enjoyed in moderation is essential for maintaining a good mindset and a healthy relationship with food.However, it is also important to practice awareness when it comes to sugary foods. Doing so can help prevent overconsumption and an increased risk of disease.As sugar is often used for energy, mindfulness and increased awareness of your sugar consumption can prevent the risk of developing obesity or weight gain. Eating sugar in excessive amounts can generate more energy than your body has a use for. This leads to excess energy being stored as fat. In time, it can contribute to this gained weight (Faruque et al., 2019). Just ask our weight loss dietitians. Understanding food labels when it comes to sugar consumption is critically important. It’s also something that a sugar 101 post must address.Undoubtedly, there are many claims on food labels that can make understanding them very confusing. Being able to read food labels and understand them is a very important factor in nutritious eating.We will break down some of the common claims and ingredients to help you better shop and understand the foods you are consuming. Products that claim to be sugar free or contain zero sugar often have a sugar content less than 0.5 g per serving size (Health Canada, 2022).These products can also have the claim “Low in energy.” (Health Canada, 2022) They may also contain alternative natural or artificial sweeteners.Products that claim to be low in sugar contain 5 g or less of sugar per serving size (Health Canada, 2022).Products that claim to have reduced sugar, refer to a 25% decrease in the sugar content of the product compared to the original product. A reduced sugar product is often reformulated with the intention of decreasing the sugar content to about 5 g or less (Health Canada, 2022).Products that claim to have no sugar added do not have any sugar containing ingredients. These products often contain different sugar substitutes. This allows the product to still taste sweet without a high sugar content (Health Canada, 2022).Some examples of the most common sugar substitutes include aspartame, sucralose, erythritol. These sweeteners can be found in foods such as breakfast cereals, gums, table-top sweetener packets, sweetened beverages, and many more (Health Canada, 2022).Products that claim to be unsweetened do not have any sugar containing ingredients, and do not have any sugar substitutes (Canadian Food Inspection Agency, 2024).Most often, the claim From Concentrate is found on juice boxes.Concentrate refers to the end product of fruit juice processing where excess water from the juice is removed to make the juice more concentrated (Clemens et al., 2015).The concentrate product tends to be higher in sugar content because removing the water makes the sugar more concentrated, and may remove some of the nutrients naturally found in fruit juice (Clemens et al., 2015). The current recommendations is that 10% or 50 grams of your daily caloric (energy) intake be added sugars, based on a 2000 kilocalorie diet (Sugar &amp; Diabetes, n.d).Therefore, being mindful of the sugary products consumed, and understanding food labels is important to ensure this recommendation is not exceeded.The nutrition facts on the back of products can give insight into how much added sugar is included in a product. If a product meets this 50 grams, or has a high number per serving, a regular high consumption of that product may not be beneficial to your health.Overall, carbohydrate intake requirements range from 40-65% or about 200-300 grams of your daily caloric intake be from carbs (Slavin &amp; Carlson, 2014). This includes both added sugars and healthy sources of carbohydrates such as whole grain, fruits and vegetables. The issue in today’s society is that too much sugar is contained in a large majority of the foods we eat. As disease can occur from the prolonged consumption of an unhealthy diet, high in sugar and processed foods, we must do our best to ensure that we are aware of the foods we eat and the ingredients in them can make a world of a difference.No. Not all sugar is the same. However, one thing is certain. We can make the conscious effort to consume healthier sources of sugar. This can look like having an adequate consumption of whole grains and fruits, or using honey as a sweetener.While the body uses carbohydrates for energy, it also needs other nutrients to be able to function efficiently.Therefore, the additional fibre from whole grains, fruits, and vegetables enables the digestive system to work more efficiently. As a result, it can stabilize blood sugar levels.Similarly, the vitamins, minerals, and water content in fruits and vegetables can hydrate. They can also provide the body with additional support against fighting disease.The goal here is not to unsettle or to cause fear of food, but to understand how food affects our bodies and minds. Certainly, when we understand their effect, we can make conscious decisions that fuel our bodies with the nutrients it needs. Consequently, this can allow us to eat delicious treats that fuel our happiness and enjoy the sweeter things in life. We hope that the sugar 101 post was helpful in establishing some basic facts about sugar. We also hope that it proves helpful in helping you lead a more informed and healthier life.

Whether you’re a student seeking nutritious snacks for school, an adult planning balanced meals for work or your kids’ lunches, or an athlete looking for ways to fuel your next workout, we’ve got you covered. Before we take a look at specific tips on how to eat well on the go, however, it’s important to review the components of a balanced diet.Let’s start with a quick refresher on the structure of a healthy meal or snack. This will help to eat healthy on the go.While the specific components here may vary based on personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budget, a general guideline for a balanced meal or snack is here below.It’s also recommended to choose water as your primary beverage to stay hydrated without added sugars, sodium or saturated fats.Take a look at this nice visual from Food Guide Canada.To eat well on the go, it is, therefore, imperative to include the following components. Whether you are trying to lose weight or build muscle, you cannot underestimate the importance of adequate protein intake.According to our sports nutritionists, protein is crucial not only for achieving your fitness goals, but also for maintaining optimal health.Indeed, you should consume at least 0.8-1 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. This means that, for example, a 50 kg (about 110 pounds) adult should aim to consume at least 40-50 grams of protein to meet their body’s needs.Athletes, or those who lead active lifestyles, however, may benefit from protein intakes as high as 1.4-2 grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. SourceFor reference using commonly eaten foods and portion sizes, here’s a guideline.One large hard boiled egg has around 6g of protein.Meanwhile, ¾ cup of plain greek yogurt has around 17g of protein.A 75g serving of chicken breast has around 23g of protein.Last, a ½ cup serving of boiled lentils contains about 10g of protein.Feel free to consult the nutritional facts tables found on your foods you commonly eat for a better estimate of your protein intake.The Canadian Nutrient File also contains a nutrition information for many different foods. We encourage you to peruse this resource if you are interested in learning more about the nutritional composition of your food.Additionally, with a growing number of people choosing to adopt vegetarian and vegan diets, it is important to consider the “quality” of animal and plant proteins.While animal proteins naturally contain all of the essential amino acids in sufficient amounts to support growth and maintenance of our bodies, plant proteins are often deficient in one or more of the essential amino acids (building blocks of proteins). This makes them incomplete, and therefore, less effectively used by our bodies on their own.There is a way to still enjoy your plant proteins while obtaining adequate protein intake. This is called the complimentary protein method. Essentially, using this method you eat various plant foods containing different amino acids in order to obtain all of the amino acids you need.For more information, consult this useful chart.A good example would be: beans and rice, bread and lentils, chickpeas and almonds, corn and peas.We encourage you to eat both animal and plant-based protein sources in the diet to gain the most amount of variety and benefits from both sources.If your goal is to focus on protein intake, we recommend consulting our registered dietitians for plant-based diet support for personalized advice tailored to your individual needs. A how to eat well on the go guideline must also include fruits and vegetables.Having a variety of fruits and vegetables in your diet is an important way to ensure you are getting all of the vitamins and minerals you need. They are also also a great source of dietary fibre, which helps keep you full for longer.For example, different fruits and vegetables offer a variety of nutrients. Leafy greens like spinach and bok choy are rich in folate and calcium. Oranges and red produce, such as carrots and cantaloupe, on the other hand, are excellent sources of vitamin A.Related: How to eat more vegetablesYou can consult this site for an interactive format to find which fruits and vegetables are in season in Canada. Grains should also be incorporated, if you’re trying to eat well on the go.Similar to fruits and vegetables, grains contain fibre. Fibre helps us to improve and maintain satiety (the feeling of being full) for longer.In addition to appetite management, fibre has been shown to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease. This occurs as a result of the reduction in serum cholesterol, blood pressure and inflammation in the body.As a result of this, The Canada’s Food Guide recommends that half of your daily intake of grain foods be whole grain. Reason being, these have more fibre than more processed, white grain alternatives, where much of the grain has been removed.By prioritizing whole grains in your diet, it will make it easier to reach your daily recommended fibre intake.Now that we covered the components of a healthy meal and snack, let’s look at some examples of what this can look like on the go. This is no doubt an important tip to help eat well on the go.Although pre-packaged foods are often associated with increased salt and fat content, you can prepare your own portable snacks and meals. You can easily do so by portioning bulk items into smaller servings or storing leftovers in containers for the next few days. This not only makes your meals more convenient and reduces waste, but also helps prevent overeating by having pre-set portions.If time is limited for meal prepping in your schedule, consider using “planned leftovers” for lunch the next day. You can accomplish this by making double the amount of your dinner portions. You then simply package them in advance for lunch the next day. This helps to stay on track with portions. Not to mention it helps to reduce cost from convenience options.Consider using nature’s packaging to your advantage by choosing fruits and vegetables that don’t require as much preparation. Bananas and mandarin oranges can be helpful for a portable and waste-free option. If your goal is to learn how to eat healthy and well on the go, then resort to the time-tested method of eating grab-and-go snacks.Granola bars, whole grain cereal, vegetables and hummus, cheese with whole grain crackers, single serve yogurt cups, and sandwiches or wraps can all be components of a healthy meal or snack.If you are short on time, you can often find many of these options pre portioned at local grocery stores or in the salad bar sections. Don’t overlook these.Related: How to save money at the grocery storeThe recent trend of making “homemade lunchables” may be good inspiration for how to put all of these components together into a cohesive and portable snack. This can be done without the need of cooking foods advance, reheating them in the moment or carrying utensils around.You can incorporate the same principle of building a healthy meal by using the simple formula of fruit/vegetable + grain + protein. It’s as simple as that.This could look like this, for example: cheese (protein) and crackers (grains) with boiled eggs (protein) and an apple (fruit) as a snack. No how-to-eat-healthy-on-the-go list would be complete without a mention of smoothies.Making a smoothie is a great way of getting a nutritious portable meal and snack.Whether you are looking for something to drink as a quick breakfast before work or as a post-workout refuel, a smoothie can provide plenty of satiety and nutrients without the hassle of cooking a whole meal.They are also relatively easy to carry around.  All you require is a water bottle/blender bottle with a lid. If not, you can even build your own smoothie bowl by pouring it into a resealable container with a lid and adding your desired toppings (fruits, nuts, granola).Try packaging your smoothie ingredients out into proportioned freezer bags, so that all you have to do on a busy morning is add your favourite liquid and blend together. This cuts down on time and helps you to stay on track with portions. Again, simple and easy. Another way of helping you eat healthy while on the go centres around batch cooking.While it does seem daunting having to plan and make meals in advance, it can actually save time and money to come up with a plan for what to make in the week.It’s helpful to keep a list of go-to recipes that you can cycle through and add to as you see new recipes you’d like to try. If you are the kind of person that gets bored of eating the same things every day, you can also try making batches of lean protein, whole grains and a variety of vegetables that can be mixed and matched into different meals.For example, you can roast a big sheet pan of vegetables to mix into a stir fry one day. Perhaps make fajitas another day. You can also grill some shrimp to toss into a salad or pasta on yet another day. The options are virtually endless.If you make larger portions at once, you can also freeze some for later in individual portions for a quick re-heatable meal.If you are not a fan of having the same thing over and over, consider batch prepping. Then simply freeze these meals to use when you are short on time.For example, batch prep soups or chilis that you can easily thaw for lunch the next day during busy weeks. Freezing large batches also reduces waste. Regular water intake can certainly help you eat and drink well while on the go.Water is recommended as a primary drink of choice for its significant role in our bodies. It is also one of the best options for keeping hydrated without added sugar.If plain water is… well, too plain, try adding a slice of lemon or some frozen berries for some added natural flavouring.Even if you are not drinking water (maybe coffee or tea instead) carrying a reusable water bottle or tumbler can save you money since there are many water refill stations available in public spaces such as malls and schools.In addition, you are more likely to meet your daily recommended water intake goals, when it is easily accessible for you. Many coffee shops also offer discounts for bringing your own cup. If you’re learning how to eat well on the go, be sure to resort to using frozen foods. This is a relatively easy strategy to incorporate.That said, not all frozen foods are created equal.There are many frozen foods that can help to reduce cost, waste and time spent on batch prepping or food preparation.Consider keeping frozen vegetables, fruit and lean proteins on hand for easy pantry staples that you can make quick meals or snacks with in a pinch of time.These can be easily added to smoothies, snacks such a greek yogurt, or mid-week stir-fries. It’s no doubt true that sometimes time is not always on our side. This is especially true with the ever-increasing pace of our lives. But, we must adapt.When eating on the go or traveling, it’s wise to research in advance options that offer balanced meals or snacks. Doing so can be beneficial to help you stay on track with your nutrition goals. It can also help to save time.Look for options that support a balanced diet. These include “build your own” offerings, salad bars or smoothie bars. Options of this nature allow you to control your portions. They also customize your meals to help you stay on track with your health goals.Knowing your options in advance will help you to make intentional decisions as opposed to whatever is most available in the moment to support a balanced diet.Sticking to this principle can surely help you eat well on the go.A great way to stay on track with portions while dining out is to follow the plate method.For example, when you prepare a meal at a salad bar or catered lunch at work, aim for half a plate full of vegetables. This can be a soup or side salad. Then add a lean protein option that takes up a quarter of your plate. A whole grain fills in the remainder. And voila! Keep shelf stable snack options handy at all times. Leave them in your desk drawer or car such as protein bars, canned tuna and crackers, or unsalted nuts and seeds for a quick and easy snack option while on the go.Having these snacks on hand will help save you time and money on processed snacks. It will also allow you to stay on track with your goals.Doing so can certainly help you eat healthy and well on the go. While the specifics of a healthy, well-balanced diet can vary greatly, paying attention to the composition of your everyday meals can help you build nutritionally and satisfying meals.Prioritize healthy fats, protein, vegetables and grain products. These will help to maintain a balanced diet and reach your health goals.Strategies such as pre-packaging and meal planning can be effective ways to have food ready in advance. Having grab and go snacks and smoothies ingredients on hand may also be useful for when you are in more of a time crunch. And who isn’t this day and age? If you you feel we missed any tips regarding how to eat well on the go that you feel should be on the list, please get in touch and let us know. We will gladly add them in.If you’re interested in receiving nutritional counselling for personalized meal planning or another related matter, book a free consultation and we will gladly lend a hand. Other Popular Posts:How to Create a Healthy Food EnvironmentIs Meal Timing Important?Foods for Stress ManagementHard to Digest FoodsFactors That Affect Food ChoicesNutrition Tips for the New YearAI Nutrition and Dietetics Our nutrition blog has been named one of the Top 100 Nutrition Blogs, Websites and Newsletters to Follow in 2021-2024 and one of the Top Canadian Nutrition Blogs by Feedspot.

Reason being, many look to improve their pre-workout diet. Pre-workout nutrition optimization is no doubt key to improved athletic performance. As such, we feel it’s important to address the topic in some depth. The below questions can perhaps guide to a clear-cut conclusion:Are you an athlete or someone who exercises regularly and often feel like you have low energy going into workouts?Or do you cramp often during games, practices or other forms of exercise?You could even find that you feel excessively sore and drained the following day after a hard workout, even though you follow a seemingly adequate diet.If any of these pertain to you, your current pre-training nutrition could contribute to these negative effects.Pre-training nutrition is an important part of sports nutrition that is overlooked by many active individuals. The key to understand here is that your needs are unique to you. And, by aligning your nutrition with them, you can better take control of your performance.In this post, we will take a look at what is pre-training nutrition timing. We will then outline the benefits of practicing it. Last, we will provide a framework that shows how to actually do it.We will also highlight some other effective tips for pre-workout nutrition. You may now be asking yourself what exactly is pre-training nutrition.Pre-training nutrition is, quite literally, as it sounds, nutrition before training or exercise.This practice gained a great deal of traction in the early 2000s, when the idea of “nutrition timing” was thought to maximize an athlete’s performance. Since then, this concept has been critically researched and tested to become cemented as a core nutrition principle for anyone looking to optimize their performance for fitness and sport.The International Society of Sport describes nutrition timing as the methodical planning and eating of whole foods, fortified foods, and dietary supplements at planned times throughout the day to impact the body’s response to acute and chronic exercise (Kerksick et al., 2017).Consequently, we will focus on the pre-training nutrition part of nutrition timing. We will then explain how to tailor your pre-workout nutrition to take advantage of its many benefits, such as:(Dietitians of Canada, 2016) (Kerksick et al., 2017) (Wildman et al., 2010)Considering how impactful pre-training nutrition can be on an individual’s performance, it is no wonder why it is held in such high regard when it comes to maximized performance and effective workouts. No pre-workout nutrition tips list would be complete without a close look at the role of carbohydrates.Carbohydrates reign as the king of pre-training fuel. Countless studies have consistently shown carbs to be our body’s preferred and most efficient energy source. This is especially true for endurance and ultra-endurance sports.Generally, an intake of 1-4g of carbohydrates per kg of body weight taken in 1-4 hours before exercise is a range that can be applied to most forms of strenuous exercise that plan to last longer than an hour (Dietitians of Canada, 2016).The downfall of this range, however, is that it has a very wide margin. You will need to identify two other factors to better predict how many carbohydrates to have.These are:1. Know the type of training/sport that you will be doing (e.g., endurance sports such as cross country or cycling, ultra-endurance sports such as marathons or triathlons, “stop-and-go sports” such as hockey or soccer, strength training, or light cardio).2. How long before you start will you be able to ingest the pre-training snack/meal.Once you have identified the answers to these questions, you can better plan how many carbohydrates you should have within the 4 hours before.So let’s review the different scenarios to these questions and their impact on the carbohydrate ranges.This point is critical.Ultra-Endurance sports such as marathons or triathlons require the most carbohydrates with the upper end of the range of 3-4g/kg.Endurance and “stop and start” sports such as swimming or hockey don’t need quite as much, so aiming around 2-3g/kg would be better suited.Strength/resistance training requires the least, ranging from 0.5-2 g of carbohydrates, depending on how long and hard you will be training.Aim to have a daily intake of 6-10g of carbohydrates per kg of body weight over the course of the day, spaced out between meals and snacks. This is considered optimal for most athletes (Dietitians of Canada, 2016).Related: Swimmers’ Nutrition MythsConsidering how long before you start training is extremely important. Reason being, it’s important to ensure your body has the optimal amount of time to digest the food you eat. This is not only to maximize energy levels, but also to reduce the risk of GI issues such as nausea, cramping, or vomiting (Wildman et al., 2010).Below is a general guideline to refer to: This is an important, yet sometimes overlooked pre-training nutrition tip.Protein is most typically correlated with post-training nutrition and recovery.Many studies, however, have shown a positive effect on performance and recovery following training when a small amount of protein, 0.2-0.5 g/kg, is consumed with pre-training carbohydrates (Kerksick et al., 2017).Doing so can increase the absorption of carbohydrates to be used by the body for energy. It can also reduce the catabolic effect (breakdown) on muscles during prolonged training. What’s more, it assists with recovery following exercise (Kerksick et al., 2017).Ideally, you would still want the protein source to be either fat-free or low in fat. This is because fat and fibre slow digestion and can lead to GI upsets or feelings of sluggishness.Some great sources of protein to work into a pre-training snack are:*Note that you should always experiment with new pre-training workout foods on practice days instead of competition days to gauge GI tolerance. Hydration is another significant pre-training nutrition area that requires delving into.It is no secret that proper hydration is important for anyone who exercises. Reason being, being even slight dehydration can significantly decrease athletic performance, cognitive function and the risk of cramps and injuries (Dietitians of Canada, 2016).Related: Why You Should Drink WaterGiven how crucial hydration is, it would be far from ideal for anyone to go into training or a sporting event already dehydrated, and then play catch up during training. The reason for this is that if you drink fluids too quickly, you may experience adverse effects.Aim to drink 5-10ml/kg of your body weight 2-4 hours before training to achieve a pale yellow colour to your urine. Urine colour is a reflection of hydration status. As such, it’s a great gauge to ensure you are properly hydrated before an event or training (Dietitians of Canada, 2016).If you eat foods with a moderate amount of sodium during your pre-training snack, you can also help increase the amount of water your body will store.However, a consistent intake of fluid throughout the day will always be the most effective way to ensure you are properly hydrated. Active men should aim to take in 3 litres of fluid per day. Active women, on the other hand, should aim for 2.2 litres per day.Keep in mind that fluid goals include other forms of liquids such as coffee or juices. That said, water should be your fluid of choice most often. Below are some other helpful tips to achieve optimal pre-training nutrition to help improve your workouts and performance:1. Keep high-carbohydrate snacks (such as granola bars and fruit) in your gym bag or work bags. This will help ensure you always have some way of getting in a quick pre-training snack.2. Because everyone is different, it’s important to experiment with what works best for you and your body. In fact, this is key to be able to achieve your pre-training nutrition goals. As always, personalization is of utmost importance.3. Caffeine can be a useful tool to reduce perceived fatigue and increase alertness before training. However, don’t overuse it or take very large doses. If you use it too often, you will likely reduce its effectiveness. In addition, if you take in too much, you can experience adverse effects such as an GI issues and nervousness.4. Don’t rely on pre-workout supplements for your pre-training nutrition. They usually lack carbohydrates and protein. They are also loaded with unnecessary ingredients, not backed by scientific literature. It is better to stick with what we know works and is safe for your health.5. Stay away from an excess of simple carbohydrates more than 2 hours before training. Doing so can cause your blood sugars to spike too quickly and crash before you get the chance to use all that energy.More than 2 hours away from training, it is better to have more complex carbohydrates. Reason being, they are digested over a longer period of time. Less than 2 hours from training time is a great time to focus more on simple carbohydrates because your body can use these more quickly.6. The foods you eat throughout the day will always have a greater overall impact on your performance than the food you eat right before. Make sure you eat a high carbohydrate diet full of a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean protein sources is optimal for any active individual. To understand the right amount of pre-training carbohydrates, protein, and fluids tailored to your specific needs can be a complicated task.For this reason it’s important to spend the extra time to make a concise plan. Doing so can improve your performance, recovery and fitness goals progression.What you eat most of the time, however, is always more impactful than what you eat some of the time.For adequate overall nutrition, active adults should eat 6-10g/kg carbohydrates, 1.2-2g/kg of protein, and around 15-30% of their intake coming from healthy fats. These should be spaced out between at least three meals and at least 2-3 snacks throughout the day (Dietitians of Canada, 2016).Working with a registered dietitian who specializes in sports nutrition is a great way to ensure you adequately fuel yourself throughout the day and before training, based on your unique life and needs.Below are generalized amounts for carbohydrates and protein that you can use if you are unable to calculate your specific needs at this time: We hope that this information pertaining to pre-workout nutrition has been of some help.If you’re interested in a nutritional counselling for strength training, pre-training nutrition support (or post), or any other fitness and performance goal, book a free consultation and we will gladly lend a hand. Other Related and Popular Posts:How to Build Muscle and Lose FatStrength Training Diet Myths and MisconceptionsEndurance Athletes Nutrition Misconceptions10 Nutrition Myths for Swimmers BustedSoccer NutritionHow to Boost Energy 1.

After all, it forms the foundation of healthy eating habits, effectively promoting overall good health. For this reason we feel it’s imperative that we explore in some depth ways in which we can create a healthy food environment at home and elsewhere.Before we take a closer look at some specific strategies to do so, let’s first define the term food environment. According to the European Public Health Alliance, “Food environments are the physical, economic, political and socio-cultural contexts in which people engage with the food system to make their decisions about acquiring, preparing and consuming food.”Related: Factors That Affect Food ChoicesFor the purposes of this post and within the scope of our practice, we will focus on what you can do to help create a healthy food environment at home and beyond. A healthy food environment is important because it can help exert a great deal of influence without a conscious effort on your part. It’s the old adage of “You Are Where You Live” at play. That is, where you spend your life influences your choices. In this case, food choices.A healthy food environment can effectively lead to the consumption of more wholesome, unprocessed, nutrient-rich foods, supporting your overall health and wellness goals. A healthy food environment starts with you and your mindset. We cannot emphasize this enough. Use every opportunity you can to assess and cultivate a healthier relationship with food. It’s important to keep in mind that your mindset shapes behaviours and food choices. It also helps to prioritize satisfaction and enjoyment through nourishment. In addition, it can help avoid moral language and labels such as good food vs. bad food.Simply put, a balanced outlook on food is best for long-term health and well-being.How do you achieve that?Adopt mindful eating practices.That is, reflect on your “want” vs. your “should” food behaviours. Pay attention to negative language about food. Do your best to avoid restrictive food rules. (Do you have any conscious or unconscious food rules that affect your food choices?) We’ll let the infographic do the talking. Infographic based on todaysdietitian.com Again, the infographic below illustrates some key points of mindless eating vs. mindful eating. Infographic by Commwellhealth.orgRelated: dietitian for mindful eatingMost of us regularly face various distractions throughout our lives. These distractions have an enormous impact on our food choices, and thus, our food environment. For this reason it’s important to minimize them as best we can.Here’s how you can do that:Related: Focused Eating in a World of Distraction Another strategy aimed at helping to develop a healthy food environment centres around hunger and fullness. Specifically, it calls for gauging hunger. To do so you can refer to the hunger scale below. The goal is to stay somewhere in the middle of the scale–ideally, in the green zone. Infographic by ohiohealth.com How full do you have to be, to be considered “comfortably full”? Approximately 70%. Another effective strategy to help create a healthy food environment revolves around obstacles that get in the way of making positive choices. For this reason it’s important to reflect on your personal barriers to making healthful choices.Ways to overcome time constraints.Related: Is meal timing important?These are only a handful of ideas. There are many more.To combat this challenge, you can do the following:Again, these are just several examples.Seek the help of a dietitian, nutritionist and nutrition coach.Seek the help of health professionals who can help provide solutions. To foster a healthy eating environment at home it’s important to model positive behaviour for others in the household to see. Reason being, other family members may mirror positive eating habits and behaviours, especially if exposed to them consistently. This especially applies to children.You can also engage family members in meal planning and preparation of food to strengthen a healthy food environment.In addition, it’s wise to prioritize meals as a family at the dinner table. You can go a step further in establishing a healthy food environment in your household. One way of doing so is to design or arrange the kitchen to support positive outcomes. Keep nutritious food in stock, in plain sight and within easy access in the cupboards, pantry, fridge, freezer and on the kitchen counter. An orderly kitchen may create instant gratification of calm and peace. Make a list of items that…These decisions may be challenging, but are indispensable in creating a healthy food environment. Pre-prep some nutritious, wholesome foods, so they’re always available and accessible. In particular, wash and cut produce items and place a designated bowl or container on display.Related: How to eat more vegetablesAt the same time, avoid keeping sweets on display to help solidify those healthy food choices. Take the time to research nutritious substitutions for some of your favourite foods and/or recipes.For example, try using stevia or monk fruit in your coffee or baked goods. Meal prepping is a real asset when it comes to helping instil a healthy food environment. And, it is no doubt much easier to meal prep in an organized and functional kitchen.Of course, sometimes we are limited with our possibilities because of existing kitchen layouts. Nevertheless, it is still possible to organize the kitchen in most cases.DiagramWe borrow this “Zone” concept from commercial kitchen design, which aims to be highly productive.  Practicing meal planning routines can help entrench a healthful food environment. Doing so sets the intention for healthful eating each week.So how can you do that?Here are some ideas: Presentation of meals can also help promote a healthy food environment. Food presentation is the key to pulling all 5 senses into the experience of eating. For this reason it’s important to make healthy, nutritious food that appeals to the senses. Doing so helps you to focus on satisfaction and enjoyment. And, when you enjoy the food you’re eating, you’re likely to stick to the healthful eating habit. Let’s not forget the significant role that reflection plays in creating a healthy food environment. This is why we always recommend clients to assess areas for improvement.If something doesn’t work, simply tweak or change altogether. That said, it’s important to keep in mind that everything is fluid and a work in progress.For example, if you feel that your cooking skills are not up to par or leave a little to be desired, consider a cooking class to learn new skills. Naturally, some significant challenges around healthful eating arise in social situations outside of home. For this reason it’s vital to ensure that you’re equipped with strategies that can help overcome outside-of-the-home obstacles. This is the only way to find sustained success. Carry a water bottle with you everywhere to avoid nutrient-devoid drinks such as soda. Drinking water is important for a number of reasons, not the least of which is regulation of hunger.Related: Why is drinking water important? Be prepared for when hunger strikes by packing snacks such as nuts, snack bar or fruit, and taking them with you to work. Again, to help instil a healthful food environment, it’s important to be prepared.Ensure that you have nutritious food and/or snacks with you at all times, including at home, in the briefcase, backpack, purse, gym bag, car, office desk and so on. Making a conscious and sustained effort to maximize the chances of making the best decisions to help establish a healthy food environment is critical.One way of doing so outside the home is by accessing available technology. Many restaurants will have apps you can download where you can consult nutrition information for various foods and drinks. This will no doubt help you navigate things, when eating out. Eating out certainly has its challenges. Reason being, when we eat out, the environment is designed for us.So how can you make the best choices to ensure healthy eating habits?Start by choosing places that offer a variety of balanced choices.Related: How to eat healthy and well while on the go People naturally talk about food as “good” or “bad” in social settings. Take on the challenge of using other words.Examples: Fresh, refreshing, flavourful, nutritious, creamy, brightly coloured, satisfying, crispy. Make and pack your own lunch for work. We alluded to this before and we feel compelled to reiterate the point here. Doing so is a great opportunity to prioritize your nutrition.It also acts as a chance to pack and bring something fun, so you are less likely to seek out treats later in the day. For example, pack a small dessert or a piece of chocolate. Doing so can help solidify positive, healthful habits and a a healthy food environment. What’s more, it can save a great deal of money.Related: How to Save Money on GroceriesInterestingly, it’s estimated that people who buy lunch spend on average $5 more per meal. This can quickly add up to a great deal of unnecessary money spent in the work year. And, this figure does not include any coffee shop runs either. If work provides meals or snacks, is there a healthier option? You should also stock your own office or fridge with balanced choices, perhaps single serving foods.Examples of single serving goods to try: Promote awareness and education at work because it may help build a “Team” mindset and a supportive attitude toward making greater changes together. This way everyone is on board with changing the status quo to better reflect choosing nourishment. To help foster a healthful food environment, share resources with your co-workers. These can include: recipes, courses, webinars, videos, blog posts, and apps. You can also create and take part in various office challenges and incentives. Visual cues are also helpful in promoting a healthy food environment. Examples of visual cues you can use: nutritious food posters or nutrition information on restaurant menus. Furthermore, pair up with someone who is as motivated as you are to follow healthy eating habits, or those are already choosing the lifestyle you wish to build. Enjoy a distraction free lunch together! Studies show that having an accountability partner can increase your chance of success by 95%. This is a strategy that many of our weight loss nutritionists and sports dietitians use with their clients who find a great deal of success meeting their individualized goals. In the end, creating a healthful food environment takes a conscious effort and commitment, but it is no doubt achievable. Give it a try and you’ll soon discover that the benefits are many and varied!For a personalized nutritional counselling for metabolism and nutrition matters with an on-site or online dietitian, book a free consultation or contact us for an appointment. Other Popular Posts:How to Build Food LiteracyHard to Digest FoodsNutrition and Stress ManagementWhy Work with a Weight Loss CoachHow to Beat the Afternoon Slump Maude Morin is a dietitian in Saint John.

Learn more about the specifics of metabolism. The role of the thyroid gland:Related: Thyroid health supportDietitian for hormonal balancingNaturally, the energy comes from food. Consequently, the connection between food or nutrition and metabolism is fundamental.The energy we consume is used to fill these four buckets:1. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)2. Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)3. Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)4. ExerciseLet’s analyze each of these in some detail. We simply cannot omit the topic of the metabolic rate in a metabolism 101 post. After all, it’s the centrepiece of the discussion and forms an important part of the basics of metabolism.Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy or calories the body uses when you are at rest for essential life-sustaining functions. It accounts for 60-70% of your energy use.There are a number of factors that affect the metabolic rate. These include:A common myth that circulates is that we cannot affect change on our metabolism. This could not be farther from the truth. Of course, there are factors such as genetics, age and body size that we cannot control. That said, however, it is no doubt possible to affect change on the basal metabolic rate via physical exercise and diet. Here’s how:How dieting slows metabolismSimply put, when you lose weight, the BMR slows down. This is entirely normal–you’re in a small body after all!When you lose weight, you also usually, though not exclusively, lose muscle mass. As a result, you lower the BMR.It seems that BMR slows more than is anticipated in people following crash or fad diets that lead to rapid weight loss.Interestingly, slow and gradual weight loss does not seem to have the same effect on your metabolism. This is what makes slow and gradual weight loss something that can be maintained after it’s undertaken.Learn more: Exercise, metabolism and weight: New research from The Biggest LoserRelated: Dietitian support for weight lossMyth: Yo-yo dieting means you have a broken metabolism.Your metabolism can be broken or ‘sleeping’. There are, however, steps you can take to rectify this.Why is that?Instead, build a whole foods diet, rich in plants, that’s sustainable for you. Before we tackle dietary changes to affect metabolism, let’s take a brief look at TEF, otherwise known as the Thermic Effect of Food.The amount of energy or calories burned to turn food into energy.This accounts for approximately 10% of the energy you use each day.Which macronutrient has the highest TEF (burns the most energy)?Protein has the highest TEF.TEF protein: 4 calories per gram of protein; 20-30% of these calories are used in metabolism.TEF carbs: 4 calories per gram; 5-10% of these calories are used in metabolism.TEF fats: 9 calories per gram; 0-3% of these calories are used in metabolism.The current dietary guidelines recommend 0.36g per pound.It’s also important to note that to achieve metabolic health, it can help to increase the above amounts, so that protein intake is higher depending on your age, health status and body/fitness goals. This will vary for muscle building, fat loss and endurance performance.For more information consult our sports nutrition dietitians. Simply put, NEAT is the energy used doing just about everything. There are, however, three exceptions:It accounts for 15-30% of daily energy use.It’s also important to note that there is a good deal of room to improve the metabolic rate with NEAT simply by reducing sedentary behaviour.That said, we must remind that these activities do not replace the physical health benefits of actual cardio- and strength-based exercise.What do we mean by exercise? When we refer to exercise, we refer to the energy used during moderate to vigorous intensity activity.Examples:It accounts for approximately 5% of daily energy use. High-level or professional athletes are a notable exception. An even greater percentage of their energy use can come from exercise.The current recommendations for exercise call for 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity activity per week &amp; minimum of two resistance based workouts per week.Related: Personal trainer and dietitian This is a commonly asked question, one that we cannot omit, when analyzing metabolism basics.Let’s take a closer look.What is metabolic flexibility?Metabolic flexibility refers to the body’s ability to use different forms of fuel for energy, depending on the nutritional choices you make.In response to:On a day-to-day basis, your metabolic rate shifts slightly, perhaps marginally, if at all. In fact, it’s quite consistent. Your body’s goal is to maintain homeostasis after all (or a state of consistency and stability).Producing energy in the mitochondria needs glucose, no matter what. Having metabolic flexibility means we can make it from carbohydrates, or fats.

Just be mindful that prolonged and/or excessive heat exposure can cause heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Cold exposure, too, may impact metabolism.Cold exposure:Interestingly, cold exposure is thought to make you more cold-tolerant over time as your body produces more heat-generating fat cells (brown fat).How can you expose your body to the cold in a safe way?Cold shower or bath are just two ways of doing so. As always, exercise caution when doing so. It’s worth noting that your metabolism is the life sustaining activity within every living cell in your body. We cannot affect changes to most factors that control our metabolism. That said, however, you can focus on taking care of yourself in other ways, and your metabolic health will follow.In other words, follow metabolism basics: eat a wholesome, nutritious diet, exercise regularly and get adequate sleep on a regular basis. Although metabolism and its connection to nutrition are a multi-faceted topic, we’ve provided an adequate metabolism 101 overview, or a crash course in metabolism basics.

Learn more about our team. In this post: Many popular diets exist today. Some are approved by healthcare organizations, while many others fall under the fad diet umbrella and, at the time of writing, are not backed by regulated health professionals. Our team of registered dietitians and nutritionists has sifted through the evidence, including relevant studies and research, and put together a list of popular diet reviews. Each diet analysis includes the origin of the diet, associated health benefits and drawbacks, important considerations, and the verdict of our dietitians and nutritionists: recommended or rejected.But, before we get to the popular diet reviews by our team of nutritional practitioners, let’s first examine the reasons why people diet. There are many reasons why people decide to try various diets. Here are some of the more common ones.Some people see diets simply as a quick fix for some health-related matter. Those who experiment with various diets (for example, weight loss) are often more interested in the short-term rather than the long-term. Simply put, they want relatively immediate results, no matter what the goal(s).Perhaps the most common hasty remedy is dieting for weight loss.In many cases, however, weight loss may be a complicated, multi-layered matter. It may require longer care of a health professional. Although this can vary, for weight loss to be healthy, many factors have to be taken into consideration. This is what our dietitians and nutritionists for weight loss do when they counsel clients.It is no doubt important to ensure that while you are losing weight, your diet is nutritionally balanced. Many people who diet often disregard this fact and elect to skip various foods and even entire food groups. Doing so may be detrimental in the long-run.Why You Should Work with a Weight Loss CoachSome people also turn to popular diets because they simply love trends. To some, having the latest or newest thing helps them feel ‘in’ or hip. These people may have their ears to the ground, always aware of the most current trend. Having this mindset may make it more likely that you try the newfangled diet that people rave about.Surely, vanity is another reason why people may follow popular diets. For example, if the goal is to lose weight simply to look better, a fad diet may promise to bring about results rather quickly. As we alluded to before, in these cases prioritizing superficial results over long-term health and nutritional balance is the driving force.A close cousin of vanity, superficiality also contributes to why people diet. To some, outward appearance of health is of primary concern. Overall health, nutrition and well-being, however, need to be examined from more of a holistic standpoint, inwardly and outwardly. Sure, you can be fit, lean and/or muscular, but you may suffer from nutrient-deficiencies, digestive distress or even disordered eating–things that may not be easy to spot at first glance.Both, men and women face various societal pressures to adhere to norms and often unrealistic and unattainable ideals to look a certain way. This has been perpetrated for years by media and the diet culture, shaping the minds of most people. The overwhelming pressure that some people feel to be thin, as an example, can and does lead to disordered eating patterns. It can also lead people to take short-cuts (read: fad diet) to attain this idealized version of themselves.Furthermore, some people undertake popular diets simply because they unconsciously imitate the behaviour of others. This phenomenon is called mirroring. When these people see their friends and family follow various diets, they may be inclined to try the diets themselves.When people see something often enough, they begin to see it as a norm. As a result, they are more likely to engage in the same behaviour.Some people, on the other hand, may engage in some form of popular diet or fad for athletic reasons. This is something that our sports dietitians see from time to time.For example, certain athletes may engage in restrictive eating behaviour in order to shed weight, be it for some form of competition or not.Various health conditions may also prompt people to follow certain diets. We’ll address this in greater detail a little later in the post. Our dietitians and nutritionists have reviewed a number of these popular diets by examining the benefits, drawbacks and important considerations. They also provide a verdict on whether or not each popular diet is recommended.Let’s take a look at some of these popular diets: No popular diet review would be complete without an examination of arguable the most popular diet at the time of writing: the Ketogenic diet.Keto diet calls for the consumption of high-fat foods while drastically reducing the intake of carbs. In other words, it’s a high-fat (often 70-80%), very-low-carb (5-10%) diet, which comprises approximately 20-25% protein.Keto diet drastically reduces carb intake and replaces it with fat. This reduction in carbs puts your body into a metabolic state called ketosis. Your body then burns fat for energy, since it doesn’t have much glucose. It also turns fat into ketones in the liver, which can supply energy for the brain. Related: Nutritional support for endurance athletes Did you know that the keto diet was developed in the 1920s to treat epilepsy in children where medication was ineffective?Learn more about keto and epilepsy.No reputable long-term studies have been conducted on the effectiveness and health benefits of the keto diet.Not recommended. According to Mayo Clinic, a Paleo Diet is a dietary plan based on foods similar to what might have been eaten during the Paleolithic era or early Stone Age, which dates from approximately 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago.In other words, the Paleo Diet places focus on foods that in the past could be obtained by hunting and gathering. At the same time, the diet limits foods that became common when farming emerged about 10,000 years ago. These foods include dairy products, legumes and grains.In a nutshell, the goal of a Paleo Diet is to return to a way of eating that’s more like what early humans ate during the mentioned age. According to Mayo Clinic, the diet’s reasoning is that “the human body is genetically mismatched to the modern diet that emerged with farming practices.” This idea is often referred to as the discordance hypothesis.The Mayo Clinic goes on to explain the hypothesis as follows:“Farming changed what people ate and established dairy, grains and legumes as additional staples in the human diet. This relatively late and rapid change in diet, according to the hypothesis, outpaced the body’s ability to adapt. This mismatch is believed to be a contributing factor to the prevalence of obesity, diabetes and heart disease today.”In relatively recent years, the Paleo Diet has been popularized by many celebrities who continue to tout its effectiveness.Jessica Biel, Matthew McConaughey, Miley Cyrus, Kanye West, Gwyneth Paltrow, Phil Mickelson and many others, have tried and found success on the Paleo Diet.    Although the diet can be effective in some situations, it may bring about deficiencies in nutrients. As a result, these deficiencies may negatively impact health.Not recommended. Atkins Diet is a low-carb diet that focuses on eating protein and fats without the need for calorie counting.The Atkins Diet was originally promoted by Dr. Robert C. Atkins, who wrote a best-selling book about it in 1972. The book has sold over 12 million copies and has been dubbed “the best selling fad diet book ever written”.  To calculate net carbs, take a food’s total carbs and subtract:a) FibreSince our body doesn’t have the enzymes to break down fibre, it passes through our digestion system unchanged.b) Sugar alcoholsIt’s also important to note that sugar alcohols such as xylitol and erythritol need to be subtracted. Sugar alcohols taste sweet, but their molecular structure is slightly different from that of sugar molecules, which leaves sugar alcohols indigestible.Additionally, certain sugar alcohols do impact blood sugar. For this reason, you should factor them into your net carb count if you eat a large amount or are diabetic.Carb consumption is no doubt fine, in moderation. In fact, most people do better with some high-quality carbs in their diet.However, excess carbs—and especially refined carbs such as bread, pasta, sugars, and so on—can:Related: How to Cut Carbs The premise behind the Atkins Diet is that when you keep net carbs low enough—under about 50 grams a day—your body goes into ketosis: a state in which you shift from burning glucose, or carbs, for energy to burning fat, including body fat. We mentioned this when we discussed the keto diet.Again, the Atkins Diet does work in some situations, even long-term. It, however, carries too many drawbacks for it to be a balanced, sustainable way of eating conducive to overall health.Not recommended. It’s a fact that some foods contain ingredients that can trigger or worsen inflammation. As such, the purpose of the anti-inflammatory diet is to prevent and/or combat this inflammation.Consequently, an anti-inflammatory diet favours fruits and vegetables, foods containing omega-3 fatty acids, whole grains, lean protein, healthful fats, and spices. On the other hand, it discourages or limits the consumption of processed foods, red meats and alcohol.Discover more about food and inflammation.Undoubtedly, two of the most popular diets that are anti-inflammatory in nature are the Mediterranean and DASH diets.Related: Dietitian for anti-inflammatory diet Simply put, the Mediterranean Diet is a heart-healthy diet that includes foods consumed by people who live in the countries around the Mediterranean Sea, such as Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey and so on.When it originated in the 1960s, the Mediterranean Diet only focused on the cuisines of Greece, Turkey, Italy and Spain. Since then, however, it has incorporated other cuisines from the Mediterranean, such as those of the Levant (Levant: modern-day Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, etc.) and North Africa. Furthermore, it’s worth noting that the Mediterranean Diet does not carry strict rules or regulations, per se. It’s not a diet in the strictest sense of the word, but more a way of eating. Because the diet is rich in flavourful ingredients such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, heart-healthy fats and so on, researchers noted that these people were exceptionally healthy and had a low risk of many chronic conditions.This infographic courtesy of Medical News Today accurately illustrates the gist of the Mediterranean Diet.Related: Dietitian for brain health  Did you know that the Mediterranean Diet regularly tops the list of the best diets overall in the annual U.S. News &amp; World Report?The panel of nutrition, health and medical experts routinely analyzes 40+ diets and ranks them according to their overall health benefits and value. The Mediterranean diet came out on top once again in 2022.As long as foods such as carbs and alcohol intake are moderated, this heart-healthy, balanced diet works.Recommended. The DASH diet is a healthy-eating plan designed to help treat or prevent high blood pressure (hypertension). DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.The U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked the DASH Diet as the second best diet.The DASH diet includes foods with nutrients that help control blood pressure.These nutrients are:Calcium-rich foods include dairy products, almonds, anchovies, cooked spinach, fortified orange juice, beans, tofu prepared with calcium sulfate, et al.Most fruits and vegetables generally have some potassium. Some examples of these foods include banana, avocado, potato and tomato. Whole grains can also contain some potassium, as can oatmeal, quinoa, whole grain bread and cooked brown rice.Foods that contain substantial magnesium include pumpkin seeds, chia seeds, almonds, peanuts, cashews and oatmeal, amongst others.While the DASH Diet focuses on the inclusion of the aforementioned nutrients, it also limits foods that are high in sodium, saturated fat and added sugars.  The DASH Diet can be effective in managing hypertension.Recommended.And, if you require help from a dietitian to manage high blood pressure, by all means, get in touch with us, and we will gladly help. Intermittent fasting is cycling between eating and fasting. In other words, you fast or abstain from eating for a given period of time, eat, and then fast once again.Consequently, intermittent fasting is not a diet, per se, but more of a relatively recent trend. What’s more, unlike other diets that primarily focus on what to eat, intermittent fasting focuses on when to eat.So let’s take a look at what it is exactly.As stated, intermittent fasting involves a period without eating. After hours without food, the body exhausts its sugar stores and starts burning fat. This is often referred to as metabolic switching.According to John Hopkins University, intermittent fasting works by prolonging the period when your body has burned through the calories consumed during your last meal and begins burning fat.Various intermittent fasting schedules exist. You can learn more about it here: Intermittent Fasting: Benefits, Drawbacks and Important ConsiderationsRelated: Dietitian for weight loss  Although a systematic review of 40 studies, including Harvard University, found that intermittent fasting was effective for weight loss, more high-quality studies including randomized controlled trials with follow-up of greater than one year are needed to ascertain long-term effectiveness.Undecided. We’re sitting on the fence here.Related: The importance of meal timing As we always say, we are all made differently, have varying dispositions, dietary conditions, preferences, lifestyles, cultural and religious backgrounds, budgets, and so on, that our eating habits should reflect that. Because we are so different, our approach to eating centres around personalization–something fad diets are not.Although some diets have practical health benefits, they also possess many drawbacks. For this reason, we don’t recommend most diets, with exceptions. Rather, we favour a personalized approach to health. In the end, you can take positive elements from each diet and apply them to your individual situation. These are all good elements that can be incorporated into our lives.From the Ketogenic Diet: Eliminate sugar.From the Paleo Diet: Eat fruits, vegetables, nuts &amp; seeds.From the Atkins Diet: Reduce carb intake to lower insulin &amp; blood sugar levels.From the Mediterranean Diet: Eat heart-healthy fats &amp; enjoy the nutritional balance.From the DASH Diet: Take in adequate amounts of potassium, calcium &amp; magnesium to help manage hypertension.From intermittent fasting: Provide your body with a rest from the ingestion of inflammatory foods.Last, we hope that the above diet reviews provided some insight on some of the most popular diets out there today.If you require a personal in-person appointment or would like to engage our online dietitian services, contact us or book a free consultation. Other Popular Posts:Nutrition Myths vs. FactsPros And Cons Of Keto DietGut Health 101Factors That Influence Food ChoicesPros and cons of AI in Nutrition JM Nutrition’s blog has been named one of the Top 100 Nutrition Blogs, Websites and Newsletters to Follow in 2021-2023 and one of the Top Canadian Nutrition Blogs by Feedspot.

Learn about our team In this post:  What comes to mind when you think of the word nutrient?Is it carbohydrates? Fats? Protein?The most important nutrient, however, and the one that may not immediately come to mind, is water.According to Merriam-Webster, a nutrient is a substance or ingredient that promotes growth, provides energy and maintains life.Since a nutrient is a compound that is essential to life (1), water is no doubt fits this description.Water makes up approximately 60-70% of our body weight. Due to the average difference between the body compositions, males have a higher water content than females.Additionally, babies have the highest composition of water (in terms of the percentage).(2)Unlike other nutrients such as fat and protein, water is not stored. As a result, the body is in constant need of its replenishment. Whether through drinking fluids or eating foods that contain water, it’s important to be aware of the amount of water you ingest in order for the body to function optimally. Undoubtedly, the benefits of drinking water are many and varied. They are also critically important.Let’s assess the importance of drinking water by looking at some of these benefits. Drinking water is important because of its impact on cells.Cells are composed of nearly 70% water. As a result, water replenishment is crucial for cell health and function. Water also assists in carrying nutrients to cells. (2, 3) It is a well-known fact that water keeps the body temperature balanced through sweating.When the body becomes too warm, due to hot weather or a fever, sweating helps to cool the body temperature.(2)As such, the importance of water cannot be understated as thermoregulation is vital to our survival.Related: Summer Nutrition Tips An important benefit of drinking water is that it helps the digestive system break down foods. (2) This effectively facilitates the absorption of nutrients needed by the body. Water is essential for another reason: it transports nutrients in the body.More specifically, carbohydrates, fats and proteins are carried in the bloodstream after the digestive system absorbs the essential nutrients for energy. (2) As a result, water is indispensable. Another benefit of drinking water is that it helps to reduce constipation. In fact, dehydration is the leading cause of constipation, which can bring considerable digestive distress.Water is crucial as the large intestine absorbs it and changes the digestive waste from liquid into stool. (5) In other words, water is needed to move waste through. This, in turn, helps you stay regular.Related: Gastrointestinal dietitians This is an important, and often neglected, benefit of drinking water.According to Medicinenet.com, not drinking enough water has the following effects on blood pressure:Related: Dietitian for high blood pressure When dehydrated, blood volume (the amount of blood in your system) is lowered. (6)To compensate, the heart beats faster in order to get as much blood as it can moving around the body.When you are hydrated, however, your heart rate is steady (excluding other factors such as exercise and stress).Additionally, according to the Heart Foundation, “when you are dehydrated, your blood retains more sodium, thickening your blood and making it harder for your blood to circulate through your body. Keeping your body hydrated helps your heart pump blood more easily and allows oxygen to reach your muscles, which helps the muscles work efficiently.”This is no doubt one of the more important benefits of drinking water, as noted by our team of heart health dietitians. Another benefit of water that is worthy of note is it helps to lubricate and cushion joints.How does water help in this process?Joints are surrounded by liquid called synovial fluid, of which water is a component. This fluid keeps the joints (e.g., wrists, knees, ankles, shoulders and hips) smooth and reduces friction between them, much like lubricant for a car engine. (2,7)Related: Arthritis dietitian As alluded to in a previous point, drinking water is important because it helps to eliminate metabolic by-products or waste products, excess electrolytes (sodium and potassium) and urea through urination.Increased water intake results in greater filtration of the blood in the kidneys, as kidneys act like a blood cleaner. This in turn produces more urine, which removes any waste in the bloodstream. (2,8) In our nutritional counselling practice, our dietitians who counsel clients with kidney health concerns, frequently underscore the importance of water in kidney health.Two of the problems that may arise as a result of chronic lack of water intake  are kidney stone and gallstone formations.Related: Dietitian for gallbladder healthThere is strong evidence in support of the fact that water intake may reduce the chances of kidney stones. There is also a possibility of water intake preventing gallstones as well. (2,8) Other than taking antibiotics, healthy water intake may play a role in preventing UTIs, such as cystitis, by clearing the bladder of bacteria.This is a low-risk and low-cost intervention method. (2,8)As always, we recommend visiting your family physician if you are having concerns or encountering symptoms. Drinking water is also important because it may play a part in skin health, according to some studies on the connection between water and skin. Although the correlation is far from being conclusive, it is worth mentioning.Related: Skin health nutritionistAcne nutritionist  Furthermore, water is beneficial because it moistens the mucous membranes, such as the lungs, mouth and nose.The mucous membrane is a layer that secretes mucous in order to create a thick protective fluid around the area–in this case, for breathing and keeping dirt and pathogens from entering into the body. (2) Water aids this process.In addition, dry mucous membranes can contribute a whole host of health problems. For example, dry mucous membranes in the lining of the nose may lead to frequent nose bleeds. According to our pre-natal and post-natal nutrition dietitians, drinking enough water is instrumental in upping the levels of amniotic fluid.Too little amniotic fluid, which thins the amniotic sac, can create complications during pregnancy.For example, it can have a negative impact on the baby’s development.It can also lead to a compressed umbilical cord.Similarly, it can create complications during birth. (10)For this reason, expectant mothers should ensure proper hydration levels. Related: Pregnancy Nutrition Tips Another noteworthy benefit of drinking water is its integral role in tissue repair.According to Franklin Rehabilitation, “there are three stages of tissue repair following injury. In each stage, water is a primary catalyst to help move from one stage to the other.” It is common knowledge that dehydration is the condition that occurs when the body loses too much water and fluid.This loss may be caused by a range of factors:When experiencing any of the above symptoms, it is especially vital to stay hydrated.System dehydration may be problematic, resulting in the impairment of mental and physical performance, as well as physiological function.There are a number of symptoms that you can experience when you are mildly dehydrated. As such, it is important to pay heed to these signs. Otherwise, you risk other consequences, some severe and potentially life-threatening. (11).*The latter three symptoms are more dangerous and medical help should be sought as soon as possible. (11)It is also important to understand the physiological effects of dehydration within the body in a more comprehensive manner. It is common knowledge that after physical exertion, you lose water and can become dehydrated. This is the reason why drinking water is important after physical exercise.Over the years countless athletes have been studied to understand the effects of dehydration on performance. Decrements in physical performance were observed when these athletes were dehydrated by as little as 2%. (8) For those engaging in physical activity, mild dehydration can reduce endurance, increase fatigue, reduce motivation and increase the perceived effort. (8)The sports dietitians and nutritionists at JM Nutrition continue to emphasize this fact to many of our fitness and sports nutrition clients who frequently do not hydrate adequately post-exercise. This occurs to those who take part in team and individual sports, such as endurance sports, combat sports and strength training.Once rehydration takes place, however, these physical/mental performance reducers are reversed.Related:What Should A Soccer Player Diet Look Like?Strength Training Diet Myths and MisconceptionsEndurance Athletes Nutrition Misconceptions No One Told You About As mentioned earlier, brain function can fall victim to dehydration. This is no doubt a common symptom of dehydration.Certainly, irritability, cognitive decline and confusion can occur from a lack of hydration.Mild dehydration can also affect different age groups more so than others.For example, dehydration in children (aged 10-12), young adults (aged 18-25) and older adults (aged 50-82) can cause disruptions in concentration, alertness and short-term memory. (8)Related: Dietitian and nutritionist for ADHDHigher levels of dehydration can even affect arithmetic ability and visuomotor tracking. (8)Related: Brain health nutrition supportNutrition Tips to Boost Academic Performance According to the Mayo Clinic, delirium is defined as a serious and considerable disturbance in mental ability. (12) This is a major risk factor for older individuals, especially those with dementia. (8)Related: Dietitian for older adultsStudies of long-term care residents have also shown that dehydration resulted in cognitive confusion in the elderly. In fact, this is a commonly occurring symptom of dehydration.It is equally important to note that older individuals often claim to feel less thirsty. This is because of a reduced thirst sensation when compared to the younger population. (7) This can lead to lowered water intake, and consequently, dehydration. As mentioned in the benefits of hydration section, an important benefit of drinking water is that it aids digestion. Reason being, water and other gastric juices help to break down food.When dehydrated, on the other hand, constipation can occur. In addition, passing stool may be difficult.When there is insufficient water in the body, the large intestine absorbs more water from the food waste travelling through. This effectively dries out the waste. As a result, stool passing may become painful.A study which zeroed in on this area indicated that those who were water deficient had reduced constipation after increasing their water intake. (8)Learn more about the basics of digestive health. Kidneys are essential in keeping a water balance and regulating blood pressure. This is done by filtering the blood. Anything unwanted is then disposed off in the urine. (7)When the water content is too low in the blood, less filtration occurs–clearly a significant negative symptom of dehydration.Furthermore, dehydration may lead to kidney damage, though this may be reversed, if treated correctly. (13) A reduction in blood volume can occur via blood loss or through the loss of body water from sweating. Blood volume is distributed differently relative to the position of the heart, whether standing or lying down.As a result, moving from one position to the other may lead to a drop in blood pressure and increased heart rate. At times, this ay even lead to syncope (sudden fainting).According to our registered dietitians for heart health, this hypotension (low blood pressure) can be managed by drinking 300–500 ml (1-2 glasses) of water. Water intake may reduce the heart rate, while increasing blood pressure in individuals who have normal blood pressure, as well as those who suffer from high blood pressure. Another symptom of dehydration is the development of headaches. This includes potential increased intensity and/or frequency of headaches.Some studies have even observed that water deprivation may not only cause migraines, but prolong them.Clinical studies have also shown that those who were suffering from dehydration headaches felt relief between 30 minutes and 3 hours, after rehydrating themselves.The proposed reasoning here is that there is a reduction of plasma volume (portion of the blood) in the head. (8)Related: Nutritionist for management of headaches With water being the most important nutrient, much evidence has shown that a lack of it can be a cause of multiple morbidities. (8)There is strong evidence that links dehydration to being a major cause of urolithiasis (kidney stones), as supported by kidney health dietitians.Evidence also suggests that hydration is associated with a reduction in the incidence of constipation, hyperglycemia in diabetic ketoacidosis, dehydration in infants and exercise asthma.In addition, there is a connection of sufficient water intake to a reduction in hypertension (high blood pressure), thromboembolism, urinary tract infections, fatal coronary heart disease and stroke. (8)Further clinical studies are soon to be conducted to further solidify these associations. Nonetheless, it appears that symptoms of dehydration manifest themselves in many ways in the realm of chronic disease. So how much water should you drink per day then?The answer is not so cut and dried, as it is often purported. Reason being, the amount of water you should drink every day depends on numerous factors, both internal and external. As such, the amount varies from person to person, and from situation to situation. Water intake throughout the day should be modified according to a number of factors. These include:Your activity level throughout the day corresponds to the amount of water you should take in. For example, if your line of work requires a great deal of moving around throughout the day, then chances are that you will require more water than a person who is largely sedentary during the working day.Undoubtedly, physical exercise plays a considerable role in daily water intake. How much water you drink depends on the frequency, intensity, length of time and type of physical activity that is performed.For example, a marathon runner will likely require much more water than a golfer, under similar conditions. This is largely as a result of the loss of fluid through sweat that must be replenished to prevent dehydration symptoms.The environment also influences daily water consumption. There is no doubt about it.Those who live in hot or humid weather conditions will require additional water intake to make up for the water lost via sweat.Similarly, you will likely need to drink more water during warmer months than cooler ones due to perspiration.Likewise, if you spend more time outdoors in the sun or warmer environments, both indoors and out.Dehydration can even occur at higher altitudes, requiring more regular top-ups.Related: How to Create a Healthy Food EnvironmentHow much water you should drink also depends on your existing health condition.For example, if you have a fever or diarrhea, or are vomiting, you will require more water.In similar fashion, conditions such as bladder infections and urinary tract stones will call for increased water intake.According to our prenatal and postnatal dietitians, you may also need additional fluids to avoid dehydration symptoms, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.Related: Baby dietitianIt’s also important to note that, according to Harvard Health, “It’s possible to take in too much water if you have certain health conditions, such as thyroid disease or kidney, liver, or heart problems; or if you’re taking medications that make you retain water, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opiate pain medications, and some antidepressants.” That said, however, general guidelines that specify how much water you should drink per day exist.The U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine determined that an adequate daily fluid intake is as follows:These guidelines include fluids from water, other beverages as well as food. Approximately 20% of daily fluid intake usually comes from food and the rest from drinks.Related: Hydrating Foods For The Summer The importance of drinking water and the role water plays in so many of the body’s processes cannot be underestimated. This is precisely the reason why so many health professionals and nutrition coaches continue to harp on the fact that people should ensure adequate daily water intake.If you feel we missed an important benefit of drinking water, a dehydration symptom or any other pertinent information, please feel free to get in touch with us. As always, we welcome input from our readers.In addition, if you’re interested in an appointment on-site at one of our locations or would like to work with online dietitians and nutritionists, book a free consultation. 1.

About JM Nutrition In this post: It’s a fact that many of our clients follow a plant-based diet. It’s also a fact that many more continue to inquire about plant-based eating, asking about the pros and cons of a plant-based diet, seeking plant-based meals and recipes, and so on.For this reason we decided to take an in-depth look at plant-based eating and what it’s all about.  According to Wikipedia, sustainability is the capacity for the earth’s biosphere and human civilization to co-exist.In short, the long-term goal of food sustainability is to produce enough food to maintain and sustain the human population. In other words, we have to be able to meet our own needs today without sabotaging the needs of future generations.Before examining the relationship between plant-based eating and sustainability, it’s important to take a look at some of the primary factors that affect this long-term sustainability. The choices we make as humans with regard to food consumption greatly affect the aforementioned factors. Although we often place great emphasis on the effect food has on our health, we also need to think about the health of the environment.There are numerous ways of helping the environment. One of those ways is through plant-based eating, which is our focus here. This is largely because what we put on our plates affects land use, water supply, gas emissions and more.  Plant-based eating is a diet that consists of mostly or entirely plant-based foods.Following a plant-based diet doesn’t mean you’re a vegetarian or vegan, and that you never eat meat or dairy. Rather, it means you proportionately choose more of your foods from plant sources.  The single largest driver of habitat loss is livestock production.Why is that?For one, a great deal of land is needed for the animals. And two, vast amount of land is also needed to produce crops to feed the animals.According to Forks and Knives, the vast majority of cropland in the United States is not used to produce food that people will eat. Instead, the land is used to produce crops that animals will eat.A staggering 77% of agricultural land use is dedicated to livestock (meat and dairy products). Despite this high number, only 18% of global calories are yielded by livestock production. That’s quite inefficient. To produce 1 pound (about ½ kg) of vegetables, it takes approximately 39 gallons (148 L) of water.How does this compare to water needed to produce beef?To produce 1 pound (½ kg) of beef, it takes about 1 847 gallons (6 992 L) of water. That’s over 12 times as much!For a more complete list, visit Forks &amp; Knives.After looking at these numbers, it is clear that a plant-based diet is an effective way of addressing water scarcity as it is more conducive to water conservation. The only exception being the production of nuts, which can use a great deal of water, too: 1 086 gallons. Here are just a handful of ways in which animal agriculture causes water pollution: Reduced greenhouse emissions is another significant benefit of following a plant-based diet.Animal agriculture is an enormous contributor of greenhouse gases. In fact, in the United States, cows (beef, cheese, dairy) are responsible for about 65% of livestock greenhouse emissions. Lamb, pork and poultry are next on the list of the largest contributors.Plant-based agriculture, on the other hand, is much more conducive to reducing greenhouse emissions. Yes and no.Yes, in some ways it is better. Reason being, many of the problems associated with animal agriculture generally do not apply to the fishing industry.And no. The commercial fishing industry is beset by its own problems. Overfishing and the enormous amount of plastic from discarded nets and fishing lines are just two examples.  Following a plant-based diet also has a number of health benefits.Following a plant-based diet paves the way for people to consume more phytonutrients.Phytonutrients play an important role in fighting various diseases such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, heart disease, irritable bowel disease (Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis) and many types of cancer.Related: Dietitians for chronic disease supportThese phytonutrients, in turn, contain antioxidants that have numerous benefits. They keep the body in an anti-inflammatory state such that no cellular replication occurs (which leads to cancer), anti-aging by way of reducing the oxidative stress caused to cells, energy boosting due to the large quantities of vitamins and nutrients readily available in them, weight management and immunity boosting, to highlight a few. An advantage of eating plant-forward can significantly reduce cholesterol buildup in arteries. Specifically, it can reduce LDL, or “bad” cholesterol.This is the type of cholesterol that is deposited in arteries resulting in plaque formation, thereby reducing the amount of blood flow supplied by a particular artery. We can think of plaque formation being equivalent to a hollow tube that becomes blocked with deposits that impede blood flow. When this happens, blood doesn’t flow well in arteries and by extension, to necessary organs. Therefore, this is the type of cholesterol of which we want to have less.HDL cholesterol, on the other hand, is “good” cholesterol. This is the type of cholesterol that protects us from various heart diseases and medical conditions such as high blood pressure, which in turn, can pave the way for more serious conditions like stroke.Related: Dietitian for cholesterol managementDietitian for hypertensionPhysicians Committee for Responsible Medicine states that “In 2017, researchers reviewed 49 studies that compared plant-based diets with omnivorous diets to test their effects on cholesterol. Plant-based diets lowered total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL levels when compared to omnivorous diets. Low-fat, plant-based regimens typically reduce LDL levels by about 15 to 30 percent.” Typically, plant-based foods are higher in fibre.Stanford Health Care states that, “Plant-based, high-fiber diets that are moderate to low in red meat with minimal processed meat and alcohol have been shown to reduce colorectal cancer risk.”A diet rich in vegetables and fruits provide both soluble and insoluble fibre that allows us to have more regulated bowel movements. The lack of constipation and regularity of bowel movements avoids formation of polyps in our intestines, which are small pouches of intestinal lining.These, among many other factors such as family history, genetic mutations, alcohol use, smoking and so on, play an important part in developing colon cancer. When these polyps are asymptomatic, they do not pose a threat. However, if they become symptomatic (bleeding from the rectum, abdominal pain, change in bowel habits), then further evaluation is warranted.Either way, the verdict remains the same. Cleveland Clinic reports “Eat at least 3-5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day. Avoid fatty and processed foods and red meat in excess” to prevent colorectal cancer. Though following a plant based diet isn’t a be all and end all solution, it definitely is a precautionary step that we can take to ensure optimum gut health. Plant-based eating can potentially benefit those who suffer from Crohn’s Disease and irritable bowel disease. This is one of the recommendations our digestive health dietitians make.These are a group of diseases whose pathology involves intestinal inflammation. Therefore, it follows that anti-inflammatories and immunosuppressive agents are the go-to in managing these diseases since they play an important role in decreasing inflammation.National Centre for Biotechnology Information states that, “Overall, westernized diets tend to decrease microbial diversity (dysbiosis) and a plant-based diet (PBD) tends to increase microbial diversity. This difference in microbiota results in differences in microbial metabolites. Westernized diets result in increased production of ammonia, indoles, phenols, and sulphide that may be detrimental to our health. In addition, they result in decreased production of short-chain fatty acids like butyrate. These metabolites have diverse beneficial effects in nutrition, immunity, and epithelial barrier. PBD results in increased production of short-chain fatty acids.”Thus, by incorporating a more plant based diet, we can increase these beneficial phytonutrients that help in fighting chronic diseases, thereby targeting the root cause of inflammation.Related: Crohn’s and Colitis Dietitian Perhaps the most influential impact of plant-based eating centres around obesity. It is well known that obesity can lead to many cardiovascular diseases as well as diabetes.The Harvard Gazette states that, “a diet rich in healthy and plant-based foods is linked with the presence and abundance of certain gut microbes that are also associated with a lower risk of developing conditions such as obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, according to recent results from a large-scale international study.”With obesity on the rise, especially with a meat-heavy diet, it is obvious that eating a plant-based diet can result in weight loss and even a lower BMI. When we function at the desired BMI, we also eliminate the possibility of developing conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes.National Academy of Sports Medicine reports that, “One study had people switch from a normal way of eating to a plant-based diet and tracked their results for 18 weeks. In this study, the people who switched to a plant-based diet lost 5 pounds more than people who did not change their diet(4).Other studies have found similar results, wherein adopting an energy-restricted, plant-based diet for nine weeks resulted in 10 pounds more weight loss than in the control group (4,5).It is no wonder then, that diabetics are recommended to follow the Mediterranean Diet. That is, a diet rich in healthy fats, nuts, olive oil and lean protein such as fish and chicken.In addition, Cleveland Clinic reports that, “If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, choosing to be a vegetarian can be a healthy option.”Cleveland Clinic goes on to say that research shows that following a vegetarian or even a plant-based diet can help you manage diabetes. These types of diets have also shown to help prevent or reverse type 2 diabetes. Reason being, foods high in fibre are slower to digest, so elevations in your blood sugar are less likely to occur. Fibre also provides a feeling of fullness. This usually reduces the overall number of calories eaten and may help you lose weight too.Related: Weight Loss Nutritionists and Dietitians Another promising benefit of eating a plant-based diet is evident in the effects it has on developing Alzheimer’s disease.Alzheimer’s is a type of neurodegenerative disease that affects memory. In some instances, it can also affect behaviour. Although there is no specific cure, there are some preventative measures we can take to decrease our chances of being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s.Related: Dietitian for brain healthThe DASH Diet stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. This is one of the first management steps advised by physicians to bring blood pressure under control.What’s that got to do with Alzheimer’s?It has been studied for years that our overall health is determined by a multitude of factors: what we eat, how much we exercise, how well we control our blood pressure and stress to name a few. The list goes on.John Hopkins Medicine found that, “older people with high blood pressure, or hypertension, were more likely to have biomarkers of Alzheimer’s in their spinal fluid.Another study found that the more blood pressure varied over an eight-year period, the greater the risk of dementia.”The Mediterranean diet, discussed earlier, also has a similar effect. As such, it has been gaining popularity in recent years due to the numerous benefits associated with it.Mayo Clinic states that, “Born as a hybrid of two existing eating styles with decades of research at their backs — the DASH diet and Mediterranean diet — university researchers developed the MIND diet to emphasize foods that impact brain health.”Researchers tracked eating logs in an older adult population for an average of 4.5 years to uncover trends among the diets of those who developed dementia versus those who didn’t. Their discovery was interesting. “Older adults whose diets most closely resembled the pattern laid out in the MIND diet had brains as sharp as people 7.5 years younger. That’s a substantial difference, since delaying dementia by just five years has been suggested to cut the cost and prevalence of the disease in half.” One of the more significant challenges associated with eating a plant-based diet is that we may not get the appropriate amounts of Vitamin B12.Vitamin B12 is a vitamin that is readily available. It is present in high quantities in meats and various dairy products.Health and Food Supplements Information Service outlines that, “Vitamin B12 is an essential micronutrient that contributes to normal energy metabolism, functioning of the nervous system, homocysteine metabolism (which is important in order to not develop anemia), normal red blood cell formation, immune function, cell division and reduction of tiredness and fatigue. Low vitamin B12 levels have also been linked with poor cognitive function.”For this reason it is imperative to seek nutritional counselling by registered nutritionists and dietitians to ensure adequate intake of vitamin B12 to avoid deficiency. Protein intake is yet another challenge associated with plant-based eating.When eating plant-based meals, it’s important to include various legumes and lentils in your diet to off-set the lack of protein. This may not be an ideal thing to do because legumes and lentils are also really high in fibre. When you suddenly increase fibre intake without also increasing fluid intake, you can become constipated, especially when you are prone to it.That’s why Harvard Health Publishing recommends, “A few important tips as you increase your fibre: Another potential disadvantage to eating a plant-based diet is that you may not be getting the right amounts of Calcium and Vitamin D.Both, Calcium and Vitamin D, play an important role in bone and teeth health. They are also instrumental in muscle, heart and immune function.In addition, you actually need Vitamin D in order to absorb Calcium in your body. This is the reason why most calcium supplements have Vitamin D added to them. When we don’t get enough of these, we are hindering the functions of important tissues in our body.Purdue University conducted a study that found that, “four-and-a-half servings of broccoli offer the same amount of calcium as one cup of milk. A person forsaking dairy products would need to eat as many as 20 servings of broccoli each day to get enough of the nutrient.” Some people who follow a plant-based diet can experience low iron levels.Iron is the basic building block required to make Hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a molecule that is responsible not only for carrying oxygen in our body, but also in forming red blood cells. Lack of hemoglobin can present in many ways. The most common of these are excessive fatigue and lethargy.There is also a concern regarding the bioavailability of iron. Bioavailability means how much of a particular substance is directly absorbed for the purpose and benefit it serves.Health and Food Supplements Information service reports that, “Animal-derived foods, in particular, red meat, are a rich source of highly bioavailable iron. Whilst plant sourced foods such as fortified grains and bread also provide iron, the iron (non-haem iron) in plant sources is not as bioavailable to the body as animal-derived iron (haem iron). Iron bioavailability is reduced with increased dietary fibre and phytates (found in wholegrain or bran-based cereals and breads).” Attaining the right amounts of fatty acid levels is also an area of concern with a plant-based diet.National Centre for Biotechnology Information states that, “Essential fatty acids are fatty acids that humans must ingest for good health because our bodies do not synthesize them.Only two such essential fatty acids are known. One, Linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid), and two, Alpha-Linolenic Acid (an omega-3 fatty acid).Deficiency in essential fatty acids may manifest as skin, hair and nail abnormalities.Related: Nutritionist for skin healthThe fatty acids that vegans are most likely to be deficient in are the omega-3 fats. Adequate intake of omega-3 fats is associated with a reduced incidence of heart disease and stroke.”For this reason it is important to consume foods that are good sources of omega-3 fats. They include ground flax seeds, flax oil, walnuts and canola oil. Following a plant-based diet can be a challenging experience for beginners. This is especially true for those who want to eat plant-based foods, while making sure that they acquire all essential nutrients.For this reason, and as with many special diets, it is important to seek the help of qualified nutrition professionals. Nutritionists and dietitians can assist in creating nutritionally-balanced plant-based meal plan. And this is very important for overall health. Navigating certain social situations can also form an obstacle for those keen on plant-based eating. For example, some restaurants do not offer many plant-based meal options. This often leaves plant-based dieters with limited options. Similarly, this can be true if a plant-based dieter finds him or herself at a party where choices are few.Of course, it is always a wise decision to do a little research and find out if the given restaurant offers plant-based meals. Likewise, contacting the host of the party and asking him or her to modify the menu slightly can go a long way in helping those who insist on eating plant-based foods at all times to be able to enjoy both, the party and the food.  Select unrefined, unprocessed or minimally processed foods.Get into the habit of adding more vegetables into your diet.A good way to do this is by introducing rules. Rules provide structure. Adopt the half-plate rule. In other words, half the plate consists of vegetables. In addition, you can add more vegetables to a stir-fry, a pasta dish or even an omelet. You can even try zoodles or cauliflower rice.Peas, chickpeas, lentils and beans often form an important part of those on a plant-based diet. In fact, they are often staples. As such, they cannot be overlooked.Fats in olive oil, olives, nuts and nut butters, seeds (chia, hemp, flax, pumpkin), and avocados are particularly healthy choices. Add them in whenever and wherever you can.Try a variety of green leafy and cruciferous vegetables such as kale, collards, broccoli, Swiss chard, spinach and other greens each day.Steam, grill, braise, or stir-fry to preserve their flavour and nutrients.Many of these vegetables are rich in Folate, Vitamin A, Calcium and Vitamin C. They are also high in fibre, and naturally low in fat and sodium.Furthermore, dark green cruciferous vegetables contain phytonutrients. These plant-based compounds may help lower inflammation and reduce the risk of cancer.Almond, cashew, oat, soy, coconut should become your close friends.Add these to smoothies, protein shakes, cereal and even coffee. You can even purchase plant-based milk that’s flavoured. Vanilla flavour is one such example. Just make sure it’s unsweetened.Start with oatmeal, quinoa, buckwheat, or barley. Then add some nuts or seeds along with fresh fruit. This is a wholesome, nutritious and delicious breakfast.Without a doubt, fruit forms a large part of those interested in plant-based eating. Eat fruit such as an apple, banana or berries, for dessert. You can also turn to fruit when you get a craving for something sweet.Fill a salad bowl with salad greens such as romaine, spinach or red leafy greens. Introduce other vegetables along with fresh herbs, beans, peas, or tofu. Add a little extra-virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Salads. too, are staple on a plant-based diet.This may require some getting used to. Perhaps a little reprogramming.At first, simply eat in smaller amounts. Implement half-and-half (half protein portion of meat and half a plant-based protein). Instead of meat forming the centrepiece of meals, it can be a side.Related: Dietitian for vegan diet &amp; plant-based eating dietitianWhile adopting a plant-based diet, it’s important to make sure it’s healthy and nutritionally-balanced.To do so limit or avoid:Related: 32 Meal Prepping Tips &amp; StrategiesHaving a variety of plant-based snacks on hand can help ensure the transition to plant-based eating is sustainable in the long-term.
