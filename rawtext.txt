Background  A healthy and sustainable diet is a prerequisite for population and planetary health. The evidence 
of associations between dietary patterns and health outcomes has now been synthesised to inform more than 
100 national dietary guidelines. Yet, people select foods, not whole dietary patterns, even in the context of 
following specific diets such as a Mediterranean diet, presenting challenges to researchers, policymakers and 
practitioners wanting to translate dietary guideline recommendations into food-level selection guidance for citizens. 
Understanding the fundamentals that underpin healthy and sustainable diets provides a scientific basis for helping 
navigate these challenges. This paper’s aim is to describe the fundamentals of a healthy and sustainable diet.
Results  The scientific rationale underpinning what is a healthy and sustainable diet is universal. Everyone shares 
a physiological need for energy and adequate amounts, types and combinations of nutrients. People source their 
energy and nutrient needs from foods that are themselves sourced from food systems. The physiological need and 
food systems’ sustainability have been shaped through evolutionary and ecological processes, respectively. This 
physiological need can be met, and food systems’ sustainability protected, by following three interlinked dietary 
principles: (i) Variety – to help achieve a nutritionally adequate diet and help protect the biodiversity of food systems. 
(ii) Balance – to help reduce risk of diet-related non-communicable diseases and excessive use of finite environmental 
resources and production of greenhouse gas emissions. (iii) Moderation – to help achieve a healthy body weight and 
avoid wasting finite environmental resources used in providing food surplus to nutritional requirements.
Conclusion  The fundamentals of a healthy and sustainable diet are grounded in evolutionary and ecological 
processes. They are represented by the dietary principles of variety, balance and moderation and can be applied to 
inform food-level selection guidance for citizens.

Background
A healthy diet is a prerequisite for a healthy life. Every -
one shares a physiological need for energy and adequate 
amounts, types and combinations of nutrients. These 
are needed for optimal growth, development, mainte -
nance, and repair of the body and as fuel for an active and 
healthy life [ 1]. Conversely, when we are unable to con -
sume a healthy diet, we may be at risk of malnutrition in 
all its forms which include undernutrition; micronutrient 
deficiencies; and overweight and obesity and resulting 
in diet-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such 
as cardiovascular disease and diabetes [ 2]. From these 
human health and well-being perspectives, a healthy diet 
has been defined as one that “promotes optimal human 
growth and development and prevents malnutrition in all 
its forms” [ 1].
Historically, understandings of what constitutes a 
healthy diet were framed in terms of the consumption of 
adequate amounts of nutrients to prevent nutrient defi -
ciency diseases [ 3]. As nutrition science has evolved we 
have learned more about associations between dietary 
patterns, i.e. “the quantities, proportions, variety, or 
combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients in 
diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually 
consumed” [ 4], and health outcomes. The evidence for 
these associations has now been synthesised to inform 
more than 100 national dietary guidelines [ 5]. Also, there 
has emerged an increasing amount of evidence showing 
that what we eat can impact environmental sustainabil -
ity [ 6] and in turn, how environmental disruptions can 
impact food production systems [ 7]. Recognition that 
there are co-benefits for population and planetary health 
from adopting diets that are both healthy and sustain -
able has led to an environmental sustainability dimension 
being incorporated into many national dietary guidelines 
[8–10].
Because people usually select foods, rather than whole 
dietary patterns, even in the context of following specific 
diets such as a Mediterranean diet, food policymakers 
and practitioners seeking to promote healthy and sus -
tainable diets face an intractable challenge of needing to 
translate dietary guideline recommendations into more 
accessible food-level advice for citizens. This challenge 
leads to practical scientific uncertainties with assess -
ing a food’s ‘healthiness’ [ 11, 12] and sustainability [ 13]. 
This paper’s premise is that an understanding of the fun -
damentals that underpin healthy and sustainable diets 
provides a scientific basis for helping navigate these 
uncertainties and informing food selection guidance.
The aim of this paper is to describe the fundamentals 
of a healthy and sustainable diet. Here, a healthy and 
sustainable diet is defined as one that promotes optimal 
human growth and development and prevents malnutri -
tion in all its forms, as well as having low environmental impact to protect food and nutrition security for pres -
ent and future generations. The paper addresses the aim 
in three stages. First, it describes the scientific rationale 
underpinning the links between dietary patterns and 
health and environmental sustainability outcomes. Sec -
ond, it synthesises this science into principles for select -
ing a healthy and sustainable diet. Third, it translates 
those principles to food selection practice to achieve 
healthy and sustainable diets. The information presented 
in this paper relates to the fundamentals of a healthy 
and sustainable diet for healthy free-living children and 
adults, not for treating specific health conditions or food 
safety issues. The ability to select a healthy and sustain -
able diet based on these fundamentals is dependent on 
the social, political, environmental and economic deter -
minants of a food system’s structure and operation which 
influence how and why food is supplied and dietary 
choices are made [ 14].
Scientific rationale underpinning the links between 
dietary patterns and health and environmental 
sustainability outcomes
For millions of years, dietary patterns were determined 
by the availability of a wide range of minimally processed, 
‘nutritious’ foods, i.e., foods which are sources of energy 
and nutrients. Requirements for energy and nutrients 
were shaped by evolutionary processes as human physiol -
ogy continually adapted to shifts in dietary patterns [ 15]. 
The food systems from which foods were sourced existed 
in harmony with ecosystems operating within ‘planetary 
boundaries’ [ 16]. Progressively, food processing innova -
tions were introduced to help protect food safety, reduce 
spoilage of highly perishable foods, make food more 
edible at the household level and increase food appeal 
among citizens.
Modern dietary patterns have transitioned signifi -
cantly from those present during most of human history 
[17]. This transition is a consequence of rapid urbaniza -
tion and changing lifestyles intertwined with food sup -
ply changes characterised particularly by the widespread 
displacement of minimally processed nutritious foods for 
‘ultra-processed foods’ (UPFs). Ultra-processed foods are 
formulations of ingredients, mostly of exclusive industrial 
use, typically created by a series of industrial techniques 
and processes [ 18]. Human physiology has not been able 
to adapt sufficiently to modern dietary pattern exposures, 
contributing to diet being a leading risk factor for the 
global burden of disease [ 19]. Concurrently, ecosystems 
have not been able to adapt sufficiently to the operations 
of modern food systems that are fostering these modern 
dietary patterns, resulting in food systems being a leading 
contributor to multiple planetary boundary transgres -
sions [ 6].

Synthesising the science into principles for 
selecting a healthy and sustainable diet
There are three principles that capture the scientific 
rationale when determining healthy and sustainable diet 
recommendations, they are dietary: variety; balance; and 
moderation. The principles need to be considered as a 
coherent whole with all three being equally important 
and interlinked. A description of each principle and how 
they relate to a healthy and sustainable diet follows.
Principle 1: Dietary variety – to help achieve a nutritionally 
adequate diet and help protect the biodiversity of the food 
supply
Dietary variety refers to eating a variety of nutritious 
foods every day. Apart from breast milk in the first six 
months of life, no single food can supply an appropriate 
balance of all the nutrients necessary for health. Foods 
with similar characteristic nutrients and nutrient pro -
files can be grouped into distinct food groups based on 
their type and nutrient composition [ 5]. Many countries 
with food-based dietary guidelines identify 4–6 ‘core’ 
food groups: starchy staples, vegetables, fruits, dairy 
foods, other ‘protein foods’ and fats and oils [ 5]. A nutri -
tionally adequate diet can best be achieved by selecting 
foods from both across and within the core food groups 
while prioritising minimally processed foods. These 
foods should be consumed in amounts recommended in 
dietary guidelines. A number of countries have under -
taken dietary modelling activities to estimate a minimum 
number and reference size of food serves to be eaten 
daily from each food group to enable nutrient intake rec -
ommendations to be met [ 20–22].
From a health perspective, foods can differ substan -
tially in their composition of nutrients and more than 
an estimated 26,000 other bioactive compounds [ 23]. 
Dietary variety increases the likelihood of consuming an 
adequate amount, type and combination of nutrients and 
other bioactive compounds for promoting nutritional 
health and preventing nutritional deficiency diseases. 
Synergistic effects among nutrients within and between 
foods are also instrumental in varied diets positively 
impacting on health [ 24]. Conversely, risk of consuming 
excessive amounts of certain nutrients and other bioac -
tive compounds that may be present in high concentra -
tions in some foods may be reduced through dietary 
variety.
From a sustainability perspective, consuming a variety 
of foods helps to protect the biodiversity of food systems 
by promoting the production of a wide range of geneti -
cally diverse food crops and species. Food crop and spe -
cies biodiversity helps increase the resilience of food 
production to threats from pests and diseases in agroeco -
systems [ 25]. This biodiversity may also help contribute to higher and more stable yields as well as lower land 
clearing and use of harmful agrochemicals [ 26].
Principle 2: Dietary balance – to help reduce risk of 
diet-related non-communicable diseases and excessive 
use of finite environmental resources and production of 
greenhouse gas emissions
Dietary balance refers to the relative dietary propor -
tions of the different food groups from which foods are 
selected. Dietary imbalances arise when the total amount 
of foods from one or more food groups is consumed in 
excessive or inadequate amounts relative to the total 
amount of foods consumed from other food groups. 
Two dietary imbalances are receiving particular atten -
tion. First, in many high-income countries, it is reported 
there is too low an intake of nutritious plant-source 
foods relative to animal-source foods [ 27, 28]. Second, in 
an increasing number of countries around the world, it 
is reported there is too low an intake of minimally pro -
cessed nutritious foods relative to UPFs [ 10, 27, 29–31].
From a health perspective, dietary imbalances are asso -
ciated with an increased risk of diet-related NCDs such 
as obesity, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and 
diabetes [ 32, 33].
Concerning the imbalance of nutritious plant-source 
foods relative to animal-source foods, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) has advised that a healthy diet 
includes [ 34]:
  •Fruit, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils and beans), 
nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, 
millet, oats, wheat and brown rice).
  •At least 400 g (i.e. five portions) of fruit and 
vegetables per day [ 33], excluding potatoes, sweet 
potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots.
Currently, the WHO (and other UN agencies) does not 
provide explicit advice on quantities of animal-source 
foods to include in a healthy and sustainable diet.
Concerning the imbalance of minimally processed 
nutritious foods relative to UPFs; UPFs are not an essen -
tial component of a healthy and sustainable diet. These 
foods often contribute superfluous energy, ‘risk’ nutrients 
(added sugar, salt and industrial trans fatty acids) and 
industrial ingredients, while displacing minimally pro -
cessed nutritious foods, from dietary patterns [ 18]. The 
WHO has advised that a healthy diet includes [ 34]:
  •Less than 10% of total energy intake from free sugars.
  •Less than 30% of total energy intake from fats. 
Unsaturated fats are preferable to saturated fats and 
trans-fats of all kinds.
  •Less than 5 g of salt per day. Salt should be iodized.

Lawrence Nutrition Journal           (2024) 23:150 
Reducing excessive dietary intake of UPFs will help cor -
rect dietary imbalances not only directly by reducing 
dietary intake of risk nutrients and industrial ingredients, 
but also indirectly by increasing dietary intake of mini -
mally processed nutritious foods (assuming the mainte -
nance of a relatively constant dietary energy intake). The 
amount of UPF that might be accommodated within a 
healthy diet will vary with a person’s nutrient and energy 
requirements.
From a sustainability perspective, consuming an exces -
sive amount of animal-source foods relative to nutritious 
plant-source foods can have significant adverse impacts 
in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, land use and deg -
radation, water use and pollution linked to nutrient-rich 
fertilisers, and other environmental indicators [ 35, 36]. 
Consuming an excessive amount of UPFs relative to min -
imally processed nutritious foods is associated with bio -
diversity loss and soil degradation, excessive use of finite 
environmental resources such as water and food pack -
aging waste, especially plastics [ 37, 38]. These multiple 
adverse sustainability impacts resulting from excessive 
consumption of UPFs are even more concerning given 
these foods are surplus to nutritional requirements.
Principle 3: Dietary moderation – to help achieve a healthy 
body weight and avoid wasting finite environmental 
resources used in providing food surplus to nutritional 
requirements
Dietary moderation refers to consuming enough food 
to provide for but not exceed the body’s energy needs. 
It is essential for optimal growth and development (until 
physical maturity is reached), to maintain a healthy body 
weight and composition (post-maturity), and to allow for 
a level of physical activity consistent with long-term good 
health (all ages) [ 32].
From a health perspective, people who consume 
enough food to provide for but not exceed their body’s 
energy needs generally have a healthy body weight and 
composition, and a lower risk of experiencing many 
diet-related NCDs, such as cardiovascular disease and 
type 2 diabetes, relative to people whose energy needs 
are exceeded. People who consume an excessive number 
and/or size of food serves from each food group beyond 
that necessary to meet their body’s energy needs may 
become overweight or obese. Living with overweight 
or obesity is associated with metabolic problems and 
an increased risk of many diet-related NCDs [ 39]. Con -
versely, children unable to consume enough food to meet 
their energy needs may have their growth and develop -
ment stunted. Stunting is also associated with poor phys -
ical, mental and functional health problems [ 40]. Adults 
unable to consume enough food to meet their energy 
needs over an extended period will suffer from undernu -
trition and will be vulnerable to adverse health outcomes [41]. Both stunting and underweight are a consequence 
of challenges with food accessibility, affordability and 
availability [ 42].
From a sustainability perspective, consuming exces -
sive amounts of food not only contributes to overweight 
and obesity, but also because it is surplus to meeting the 
nutritional needs of the consumer it is a waste of the 
finite environmental resources used in producing, pro -
cessing, distributing, storing and preparing that food 
[43]. Also, excessive food consumption usually involves 
extra food being purchased and subsequently leading to 
extra amounts of food packaging requiring disposal.
Translating the dietary principles to inform food-
level selection guidance
In practice, determining the precise amounts, types and 
combinations of foods which constitute a healthy and 
sustainable diet will vary depending on individual char -
acteristics such as age, gender, lifestage and lifestyle 
(e.g., work practices which may be sedentary or involve 
heavy manual labour), as well as cultural, social and envi -
ronmental circumstances. However, the principles of a 
healthy and sustainable diet apply equally to individuals 
and populations around the world. Dietary guidelines 
have remained broadly consistent over several decades 
for most countries and they are remarkably similar across 
the different countries [ 44], indicating that the funda -
mentals of a healthy diet persist over time and place.
Many countries and regions have published a food 
guide as a graphic representation or visualization of their 
dietary guidelines to show how the dietary principles of 
variety, balance and moderation apply to their food sup -
plies, eating habits and social and cultural circumstances 
[30, 45, 46]. The visual features and certain technical 
details of these guides vary between countries. Neverthe -
less, the nutrition science principles that inform these 
guides are broadly similar. In practical terms these food 
guides help translate dietary guideline recommendations 
into food selection advice. Figure  1 presents a synthesis 
of the common features and technical criteria of national 
food guides compiled by the Food and Agriculture Orga -
nization [ 5]. This generic guide promotes the application 
of each of the dietary principles in the following ways:
Variety
  –How the principle might be depicted : Nutritious 
foods with similar characteristic nutrients and 
nutrient profiles are grouped together into 5 core 
food groups (Vegetables; Fruit; Cereals and grains; 
Lean meat, fish, poultry, eggs, seeds, legumes and 
nuts; and Milk, yoghurt, cheese and/or alternatives).
  –How the principle might be described in 
accompanying text : ‘Each day choose a variety of 
Page 5 of 8
Lawrence Nutrition Journal           (2024) 23:150 
foods from within each of, and across all, the 5 core 
food groups. ’
Balance
  –How the principle might be depicted : In relation 
to the balance of nutritious plant-source foods to 
animal-source foods - the relative size of each core 
food group segment is broadly indicative of the 
recommended number of food servings from that 
group e.g., food groups containing predominantly 
nutritious plant-source foods will make up a larger 
proportion of the guide than food groups containing 
predominantly animal-source foods. In relation 
to the balance of UPFs to minimally processed, 
nutritious foods - an ‘Ultra-processed foods’ food 
group is separated from the 5 core food groups. 
Defining this non-core food group in terms of 
the UPF concept provides a stronger conceptual 
(grounded in evolutionary and ecological processes) 
and evidential basis than the mostly indeterminate 
current descriptors such as ‘Extras’ or ‘Discretionary’ .
  –How the principle might be described in 
accompanying text : ‘Each day choose foods from all 5 core food groups in overall amounts equivalent to 
the food group proportions set out on the guide’ , and 
‘Limit intake of UPFs’ .
Moderation
  –How the principle might be depicted : Illustrations 
show moderate portion sizes for foods from each 
food group.
  –How the principle might be described in 
accompanying text : ‘Enjoy eating when you’re 
hungry though stop when you feel full, avoid eating 
an excessive number and/or size of food serves from 
each food group and eating when you don’t have a 
sensation of hunger’(adapted from [ 47]). ’
The generic food guide is intended to serve as an example 
and therefore, be flexible with a diversity of foods from 
around the world illustrated in each of the food groups 
so that the healthy and sustainable diet principles can 
be adapted to different food habits, food supplies, eat -
ing habits and social and cultural circumstances in each 
country context.
The food guide illustrates four other considerations for 
healthy and sustainable diets:
i) Safe drinking water, preferably tap or portable 
water or water from other improved sources (e.g., 
protected boreholes) in preference to other drinks, 
especially sugar-sweetened beverages [ 48] and 
bottled water, is an integral component of a healthy 
and sustainable diet.
ii) Food and drinks to limit are predominantly UPFs 
and alcohol which are nutritionally poor and not an 
essential component of a healthy diet.
iii) Use small amounts of unsaturated vegetable oil 
(e.g. olive, soy, sunflower, corn or rapeseed) when 
required, though many Mediterranean countries 
report that olive oil makes an important contribution 
to the health benefits of Mediterranean diets and 
recommend it be generously included in food 
preparation and dressings for such diets [ 49–51].
iv) Physical activity is an important complement to a 
healthy diet.
Concluding comments
This manuscript has described how the fundamentals of 
healthy and sustainable diets are grounded in evolution -
ary and ecological processes. It reports how the science 
identifying dietary associations with population and 
planetary health outcomes can be synthesized into three 
dietary principles and translated into food-level selection

guidance. These principes are commonly represented 
in national dietary guidelines and food selection guides, 
albeit with adaptation for cultural, social and environ -
mental circumstances.
The unprecedented rate and scale of change in food 
systems and environmental settings will continue to out -
pace the ability of human physiology and ecosystems to 
adapt and evolve. The bidirectional relationship between 
dietary patterns and the ecosystems may present an 
increasing number of trade-offs to consider when prepar -
ing dietary guidance for promoting healthy and sustain -
able diets. For example, there are complex environmental 
and health considerations when comparing diets contain -
ing high amounts of animal-based foods such as meat, 
chicken and eggs, plant-based foods such as legumes 
and vegetables which are minimally processed, and novel 
plant-based food products designed to mimic and replace 
animal-based foods and which generally are ultra-pro -
cessed. Plant- and novel plant-based diets typically have 
smaller environmental footprints than animal-based 
diets though the alignment of their nutrient profiles 
with healthy diets is mixed and those containing high 
amounts of ultra-processed products are associated with 
longer term adverse health outcomes [ 52]. One study 
modelling dietary recommendations for reducing the 
amount of animal-source foods in diets, in a large part to 
mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, showed that dietary 
intakes of vitamin B12, calcium, iron, and zinc would be 
below the recommended nutrient intakes for adults and 
women of reproductive age [ 53]. These dynamic circum -
stances highlight the importance of policymakers being 
able to discern the level of processing of different types 
of plant- and novel plant-based foods as well as using 
nuanced decision-making approaches to consider the 
range of environmental and health benefits and risks of 
these foods. A future priority will be constant investiga -
tion of associations between dietary patterns and health 
and sustainability outcomes as well as ongoing review of 
the evidence base that informs dietary guidelines.
Into the future, guidance on healthy and sustainable 
diets will need to continue to be based on the synthesis 
of the best available evidence of associations between 
dietary patterns and physiological, and increasingly plan -
etary, health outcomes. Yet, dietary guidelines do not 
speak for themselves. The investment in their preparation 
will need to extend to investment in their promulgation 
to nutrition researchers, policymakers and practitioners, 
and their subsequent translation into food-level selection 
guidance for citizens.
