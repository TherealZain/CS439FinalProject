Eating a healthy, balanced diet is an important part of maintaining good health, and can help you feel your best.This means eating a wide variety of foods in the right proportions, and consuming the right amount of food and drink to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.This page covers healthy eating advice for the general population.People with special dietary needs or a medical condition should ask their doctor or a registered dietitian for advice.The Eatwell Guide shows that to have a healthy, balanced diet, people should try to:If you're having foods and drinks that are high in fat, salt and sugar, have these less often and in small amounts.Try to choose a variety of different foods from the 5 main food groups to get a wide range of nutrients.Most people in the UK eat and drink too many calories, too much saturated fat, sugar and salt, and not enough fruit, vegetables, oily fish or fibre.The Eatwell Guide does not apply to children under the age of 2 because they have different nutritional needs.After the age of 2 years, children should move to eating the same foods as the rest of the family in the proportions shown in the Eatwell Guide.Fruit and vegetables are a good source of vitamins and minerals and fibre, and should make up just over a third of the food you eat each day.It's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.There's evidence that people who eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day have a lower risk of heart disease, stroke and some cancers.Eating 5 portions is not as hard as it sounds.A portion is:Just 1 apple, banana, pear or similar-sized fruit is 1 portion each.A slice of pineapple or melon is also 1 portion, and 3 heaped tablespoons of vegetables is another portion.Adding a tablespoon of dried fruit, such as raisins, to your morning cereal is an easy way to get 1 portion.You could also swap your mid-morning biscuit for a banana, and add a side salad to your lunch. In the evening, have a portion of vegetables with dinner and fresh fruit with plain, lower fat yoghurt for dessert to reach your 5 A Day. Find out more about what counts towards your 5 A DayStarchy foods should make up just over a third of everything you eat. This means your meals should be based on these foods.Choose wholegrain or wholemeal varieties of starchy foods, such as brown rice, wholewheat pasta, and brown, wholemeal or higher fibre white bread.They contain more fibre, and usually more vitamins and minerals, than white varieties.Potatoes with the skins on are a great source of fibre and vitamins. For example, when having boiled potatoes or a jacket potato, eat the skin too.Find out more about starchy foodsMilk and dairy foods, such as cheese and yoghurt, are good sources of protein. They also contain calcium, which helps keep your bones healthy.Go for lower fat and lower sugar products where possible.Choose semi-skimmed, 1% fat or skimmed milk, as well as lower fat hard cheeses or cottage cheese, and lower fat, lower sugar yoghurt.Dairy alternatives, such as soya drinks, are also included in this food group.When buying alternatives, choose unsweetened, calcium-fortified versions.Find out more about milk and dairy foodsThese foods are all good sources of protein, which is essential for the body to grow and repair itself.They're also good sources of a range of vitamins and minerals.Meat is a good source of protein, vitamins and minerals, including iron, zinc and B vitamins. It's also one of the main sources of vitamin B12.Choose lean cuts of meat and skinless poultry whenever possible to cut down on fat. Always cook meat thoroughly.Try to eat less red and processed meat like bacon, ham and sausages.Find out more about including meat in your dietEggs and fish are also good sources of protein, and contain many vitamins and minerals. Oily fish is particularly rich in omega-3 fatty acids.Aim to eat at least 2 portions of fish a week, including 1 portion of oily fish.You can choose from fresh, frozen or canned, but remember that canned and smoked fish can often be high in salt.Pulses, including beans, peas and lentils, are naturally very low in fat and high in fibre, protein, vitamins and minerals.Nuts are high in fibre, and unsalted nuts make a good snack. But they do still contain high levels of fat, so eat them in moderation.Some fat in the diet is essential, but on average people in the UK eat too much saturated fat.It's important to get most of your fat from unsaturated oils and spreads.Swapping to unsaturated fats can help lower cholesterol.Remember that all types of fat are high in energy and should be eaten in small amounts.Find out more about the different types of fatsToo much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of developing heart disease.Regularly consuming foods and drinks high in sugar increases your risk of obesity and tooth decay.Eating too much salt can raise your blood pressure, which increases your risk of getting heart disease or having a stroke.See 8 tips for healthy eating to find out more about why you need to cut down on saturated fat, sugar and salt, which foods they're found in, and how to make healthier choices.Find out more about how to eat less saturated fatMost adults in England are overweight or obese.

Most people in the United States need to increase their intake of dietary fiber, calcium, vitamin D, and potassium. Healthy eating emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and protein. This page includes a few quick and easy tips on how to make healthy dietary choices. Good nutrition is about consistently choosing healthy foods and beverages. Healthy eating patterns can include foods and beverages that reflect preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations.Healthy eating emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and protein. Dairy recommendations include low-fat or fat-free milk, lactose-free milk, and fortified soy beverages. Other plant-based beverages do not have the same nutritional properties as animal's milk and soy beverages. Protein recommendations include seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans, peas, and lentils), soy products, nuts, and seeds.Most people in the United States need to eat more foods with dietary fiber, calcium, vitamin D, and potassium, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. At the same time, we need to consume less added sugar, saturated fat, and sodium. Here are some ways to get started.Fiber helps maintain digestive health and helps us feel fuller longer. Fiber also helps control blood sugar and lowers cholesterol levels. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds are good sources of fiber.To bump up fiber, try this:Calcium and vitamin D work together to promote optimal bone health. Our bodies can make vitamin D from sunshine. However, some people may have a hard time producing enough vitamin D. And too much sun exposure can increase the risk of skin cancer. Foods and beverages are often fortified with this essential nutrient. See food sources of calcium and vitamin D.To increase calcium and vitamin D intake, try this:Potassium helps the kidneys, heart, muscles and, nerves function properly. Not getting enough potassium can increase blood pressure, deplete calcium in bones, and increase the risk of kidney stones.People with chronic kidney disease and people taking certain medications may have too much potassium in their blood.

Sugary drinks are a common source of added sugars.To limit added sugars, try this:Replacing saturated fat with healthier unsaturated fats can help protect your heart. Common sources of saturated fat include fatty meats, full-fat milk and cheese, butter, and cream cheese.We need some dietary fat to give us energy, develop healthy cells, and help absorb some vitamins and minerals. But unsaturated fat is better for us than saturated fat. See common sources of saturated and unsaturated fat.To replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats, try this:Eating too much sodium can raise your risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke. More than 70% of the sodium Americans consume comes from packaged and prepared foods. While sodium has many forms, 90% of the sodium we consume is from salt. See the top sources of sodium.To cut back on sodium, try this:A good practice is to aim for a variety of colors on your plate. Fruits and vegetables like oranges, tomatoes, and dark, leafy greens—and even fresh herbs—are loaded with vitamins, fiber, and minerals.To get a variety of healthy foods, try this:Good nutrition is essential for health across the lifespan.
