activity and nutrition school of exercise and nutrition sciences deakin university geelong vic australiaabstract background a healthy and sustainable diet is a prerequisite for population and planetary health the evidence of associations between dietary patterns and health outcomes has now been synthesised to inform more than national dietary guidelines yet people select foods not whole dietary patterns even in the context of following specific diets such as a mediterranean diet presenting challenges to researchers policymakers and practitioners wanting to translate dietary guideline recommendations into foodlevel selection guidance for citizens understanding the fundamentals that underpin healthy and sustainable diets provides a scientific basis for helping navigate these challenges this papers aim is to describe the fundamentals of a healthy and sustainable diet results the scientific rationale underpinning what is a healthy and sustainable diet is universal everyone shares a physiological need for energy and adequate amounts types and combinations of nutrients people source their energy and nutrient needs from foods that are themselves sourced from food systems the physiological need and food systems sustainability have been shaped through evolutionary and ecological processes respectively this physiological need can be met and food systems sustainability protected by following three interlinked dietary principles i variety to help achieve a nutritionally adequate diet and help protect the biodiversity of food systems ii balance to help reduce risk of dietrelated noncommunicable diseases and excessive use of finite environmental resources and production of greenhouse gas emissions iii moderation to help achieve a healthy body weight and avoid wasting finite environmental resources used in providing food surplus to nutritional requirements conclusion the fundamentals of a healthy and sustainable diet are grounded in evolutionary and ecological processes they are represented by the dietary principles of variety balance and moderation and can be applied to inform foodlevel selection guidance for citizens keywords healthy and sustainable diet dietary guidelines dietary variety dietary balance dietary moderation ultraprocessed foods food selection guidefundamentals of a healthy and sustainable diet mark lawrence page of lawrence nutrition journal background a healthy diet is a prerequisite for a healthy life every one shares a physiological need for energy and adequate amounts types and combinations of nutrients these are needed for optimal growth development mainte nance and repair of the body and as fuel for an active and healthy life conversely when we are unable to con sume a healthy diet we may be at risk of malnutrition in all its forms which include undernutrition micronutrient deficiencies and overweight and obesity and resulting in dietrelated noncommunicable diseases ncds such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes from these human health and wellbeing perspectives a healthy diet has been defined as one that promotes optimal human growth and development and prevents malnutrition in all its forms historically understandings of what constitutes a healthy diet were framed in terms of the consumption of adequate amounts of nutrients to prevent nutrient defi ciency diseases as nutrition science has evolved we have learned more about associations between dietary patterns ie the quantities proportions variety or combination of different foods drinks and nutrients in diets and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed and health outcomes the evidence for these associations has now been synthesised to inform more than national dietary guidelines also there has emerged an increasing amount of evidence showing that what we eat can impact environmental sustainabil ity and in turn how environmental disruptions can impact food production systems recognition that there are cobenefits for population and planetary health from adopting diets that are both healthy and sustain able has led to an environmental sustainability dimension being incorporated into many national dietary guidelines because people usually select foods rather than whole dietary patterns even in the context of following specific diets such as a mediterranean diet food policymakers and practitioners seeking to promote healthy and sus tainable diets face an intractable challenge of needing to translate dietary guideline recommendations into more accessible foodlevel advice for citizens this challenge leads to practical scientific uncertainties with assess ing a foods healthiness and sustainability this papers premise is that an understanding of the fun damentals that underpin healthy and sustainable diets provides a scientific basis for helping navigate these uncertainties and informing food selection guidance the aim of this paper is to describe the fundamentals of a healthy and sustainable diet here a healthy and sustainable diet is defined as one that promotes optimal human growth and development and prevents malnutri tion in all its forms as well as having low environmental impact to protect food and nutrition security for pres ent and future generations the paper addresses the aim in three stages first it describes the scientific rationale underpinning the links between dietary patterns and health and environmental sustainability outcomes sec ond it synthesises this science into principles for select ing a healthy and sustainable diet third it translates those principles to food selection practice to achieve healthy and sustainable diets the information presented in this paper relates to the fundamentals of a healthy and sustainable diet for healthy freeliving children and adults not for treating specific health conditions or food safety issues the ability to select a healthy and sustain able diet based on these fundamentals is dependent on the social political environmental and economic deter minants of a food systems structure and operation which influence how and why food is supplied and dietary choices are made scientific rationale underpinning the links between dietary patterns and health and environmental sustainability outcomes for millions of years dietary patterns were determined by the availability of a wide range of minimally processed nutritious foods ie foods which are sources of energy and nutrients requirements for energy and nutrients were shaped by evolutionary processes as human physiol ogy continually adapted to shifts in dietary patterns the food systems from which foods were sourced existed in harmony with ecosystems operating within planetary boundaries progressively food processing innova tions were introduced to help protect food safety reduce spoilage of highly perishable foods make food more edible at the household level and increase food appeal among citizens modern dietary patterns have transitioned signifi cantly from those present during most of human history this transition is a consequence of rapid urbaniza tion and changing lifestyles intertwined with food sup ply changes characterised particularly by the widespread displacement of minimally processed nutritious foods for ultraprocessed foods upfs ultraprocessed foods are formulations of ingredients mostly of exclusive industrial use typically created by a series of industrial techniques and processes human physiology has not been able to adapt sufficiently to modern dietary pattern exposures contributing to diet being a leading risk factor for the global burden of disease concurrently ecosystems have not been able to adapt sufficiently to the operations of modern food systems that are fostering these modern dietary patterns resulting in food systems being a leading contributor to multiple planetary boundary transgres sions page of lawrence nutrition journal synthesising the science into principles for selecting a healthy and sustainable diet there are three principles that capture the scientific rationale when determining healthy and sustainable diet recommendations they are dietary variety balance and moderation the principles need to be considered as a coherent whole with all three being equally important and interlinked a description of each principle and how they relate to a healthy and sustainable diet follows principle dietary variety to help achieve a nutritionally adequate diet and help protect the biodiversity of the food supply dietary variety refers to eating a variety of nutritious foods every day apart from breast milk in the first six months of life no single food can supply an appropriate balance of all the nutrients necessary for health foods with similar characteristic nutrients and nutrient pro files can be grouped into distinct food groups based on their type and nutrient composition many countries with foodbased dietary guidelines identify core food groups starchy staples vegetables fruits dairy foods other protein foods and fats and oils a nutri tionally adequate diet can best be achieved by selecting foods from both across and within the core food groups while prioritising minimally processed foods these foods should be consumed in amounts recommended in dietary guidelines a number of countries have under taken dietary modelling activities to estimate a minimum number and reference size of food serves to be eaten daily from each food group to enable nutrient intake rec ommendations to be met from a health perspective foods can differ substan tially in their composition of nutrients and more than an estimated other bioactive compounds dietary variety increases the likelihood of consuming an adequate amount type and combination of nutrients and other bioactive compounds for promoting nutritional health and preventing nutritional deficiency diseases synergistic effects among nutrients within and between foods are also instrumental in varied diets positively impacting on health conversely risk of consuming excessive amounts of certain nutrients and other bioac tive compounds that may be present in high concentra tions in some foods may be reduced through dietary variety from a sustainability perspective consuming a variety of foods helps to protect the biodiversity of food systems by promoting the production of a wide range of geneti cally diverse food crops and species food crop and spe cies biodiversity helps increase the resilience of food production to threats from pests and diseases in agroeco systems this biodiversity may also help contribute to higher and more stable yields as well as lower land clearing and use of harmful agrochemicals principle dietary balance to help reduce risk of dietrelated noncommunicable diseases and excessive use of finite environmental resources and production of greenhouse gas emissions dietary balance refers to the relative dietary propor tions of the different food groups from which foods are selected dietary imbalances arise when the total amount of foods from one or more food groups is consumed in excessive or inadequate amounts relative to the total amount of foods consumed from other food groups two dietary imbalances are receiving particular atten tion first in many highincome countries it is reported there is too low an intake of nutritious plantsource foods relative to animalsource foods second in an increasing number of countries around the world it is reported there is too low an intake of minimally pro cessed nutritious foods relative to upfs from a health perspective dietary imbalances are asso ciated with an increased risk of dietrelated ncds such as obesity cardiovascular disease certain cancers and diabetes concerning the imbalance of nutritious plantsource foods relative to animalsource foods the world health organization who has advised that a healthy diet includes fruit vegetables legumes eg lentils and beans nuts and whole grains eg unprocessed maize millet oats wheat and brown rice at least g ie five portions of fruit and vegetables per day excluding potatoes sweet potatoes cassava and other starchy roots currently the who and other un agencies does not provide explicit advice on quantities of animalsource foods to include in a healthy and sustainable diet concerning the imbalance of minimally processed nutritious foods relative to upfs upfs are not an essen tial component of a healthy and sustainable diet these foods often contribute superfluous energy risk nutrients added sugar salt and industrial trans fatty acids and industrial ingredients while displacing minimally pro cessed nutritious foods from dietary patterns the who has advised that a healthy diet includes less than of total energy intake from free sugars less than of total energy intake from fats unsaturated fats are preferable to saturated fats and transfats of all kinds less than g of salt per day salt should be iodized page of lawrence nutrition journal reducing excessive dietary intake of upfs will help cor rect dietary imbalances not only directly by reducing dietary intake of risk nutrients and industrial ingredients but also indirectly by increasing dietary intake of mini mally processed nutritious foods assuming the mainte nance of a relatively constant dietary energy intake the amount of upf that might be accommodated within a healthy diet will vary with a persons nutrient and energy requirements from a sustainability perspective consuming an exces sive amount of animalsource foods relative to nutritious plantsource foods can have significant adverse impacts in terms of greenhouse gas emissions land use and deg radation water use and pollution linked to nutrientrich fertilisers and other environmental indicators consuming an excessive amount of upfs relative to min imally processed nutritious foods is associated with bio diversity loss and soil degradation excessive use of finite environmental resources such as water and food pack aging waste especially plastics these multiple adverse sustainability impacts resulting from excessive consumption of upfs are even more concerning given these foods are surplus to nutritional requirements principle dietary moderation to help achieve a healthy body weight and avoid wasting finite environmental resources used in providing food surplus to nutritional requirements dietary moderation refers to consuming enough food to provide for but not exceed the bodys energy needs it is essential for optimal growth and development until physical maturity is reached to maintain a healthy body weight and composition postmaturity and to allow for a level of physical activity consistent with longterm good health all ages from a health perspective people who consume enough food to provide for but not exceed their bodys energy needs generally have a healthy body weight and composition and a lower risk of experiencing many dietrelated ncds such as cardiovascular disease and type diabetes relative to people whose energy needs are exceeded people who consume an excessive number andor size of food serves from each food group beyond that necessary to meet their bodys energy needs may become overweight or obese living with overweight or obesity is associated with metabolic problems and an increased risk of many dietrelated ncds con versely children unable to consume enough food to meet their energy needs may have their growth and develop ment stunted stunting is also associated with poor phys ical mental and functional health problems adults unable to consume enough food to meet their energy needs over an extended period will suffer from undernu trition and will be vulnerable to adverse health outcomes both stunting and underweight are a consequence of challenges with food accessibility affordability and availability from a sustainability perspective consuming exces sive amounts of food not only contributes to overweight and obesity but also because it is surplus to meeting the nutritional needs of the consumer it is a waste of the finite environmental resources used in producing pro cessing distributing storing and preparing that food also excessive food consumption usually involves extra food being purchased and subsequently leading to extra amounts of food packaging requiring disposal translating the dietary principles to inform food level selection guidance in practice determining the precise amounts types and combinations of foods which constitute a healthy and sustainable diet will vary depending on individual char acteristics such as age gender lifestage and lifestyle eg work practices which may be sedentary or involve heavy manual labour as well as cultural social and envi ronmental circumstances however the principles of a healthy and sustainable diet apply equally to individuals and populations around the world dietary guidelines have remained broadly consistent over several decades for most countries and they are remarkably similar across the different countries indicating that the funda mentals of a healthy diet persist over time and place many countries and regions have published a food guide as a graphic representation or visualization of their dietary guidelines to show how the dietary principles of variety balance and moderation apply to their food sup plies eating habits and social and cultural circumstances the visual features and certain technical details of these guides vary between countries neverthe less the nutrition science principles that inform these guides are broadly similar in practical terms these food guides help translate dietary guideline recommendations into food selection advice figure presents a synthesis of the common features and technical criteria of national food guides compiled by the food and agriculture orga nization this generic guide promotes the application of each of the dietary principles in the following ways variety how the principle might be depicted nutritious foods with similar characteristic nutrients and nutrient profiles are grouped together into core food groups vegetables fruit cereals and grains lean meat fish poultry eggs seeds legumes and nuts and milk yoghurt cheese andor alternatives how the principle might be described in accompanying text each day choose a variety of page of lawrence nutrition journal foods from within each of and across all the core food groups balance how the principle might be depicted in relation to the balance of nutritious plantsource foods to animalsource foods the relative size of each core food group segment is broadly indicative of the recommended number of food servings from that group eg food groups containing predominantly nutritious plantsource foods will make up a larger proportion of the guide than food groups containing predominantly animalsource foods in relation to the balance of upfs to minimally processed nutritious foods an ultraprocessed foods food group is separated from the core food groups defining this noncore food group in terms of the upf concept provides a stronger conceptual grounded in evolutionary and ecological processes and evidential basis than the mostly indeterminate current descriptors such as extras or discretionary how the principle might be described in accompanying text each day choose foods from all core food groups in overall amounts equivalent to the food group proportions set out on the guide and limit intake of upfs moderation how the principle might be depicted illustrations show moderate portion sizes for foods from each food group how the principle might be described in accompanying text enjoy eating when youre hungry though stop when you feel full avoid eating an excessive number andor size of food serves from each food group and eating when you dont have a sensation of hungeradapted from the generic food guide is intended to serve as an example and therefore be flexible with a diversity of foods from around the world illustrated in each of the food groups so that the healthy and sustainable diet principles can be adapted to different food habits food supplies eat ing habits and social and cultural circumstances in each country context the food guide illustrates four other considerations for healthy and sustainable diets i safe drinking water preferably tap or portable water or water from other improved sources eg protected boreholes in preference to other drinks especially sugarsweetened beverages and bottled water is an integral component of a healthy and sustainable diet ii food and drinks to limit are predominantly upfs and alcohol which are nutritionally poor and not an essential component of a healthy diet iii use small amounts of unsaturated vegetable oil eg olive soy sunflower corn or rapeseed when required though many mediterranean countries report that olive oil makes an important contribution to the health benefits of mediterranean diets and recommend it be generously included in food preparation and dressings for such diets iv physical activity is an important complement to a healthy diet concluding comments this manuscript has described how the fundamentals of healthy and sustainable diets are grounded in evolution ary and ecological processes it reports how the science identifying dietary associations with population and planetary health outcomes can be synthesized into three dietary principles and translated into foodlevel selection fig generic healthy and sustainable food selection guide designed by minimum graphics copyright for this illustration belongs to the world health organization page of lawrence nutrition journal guidance these principes are commonly represented in national dietary guidelines and food selection guides albeit with adaptation for cultural social and environ mental circumstances the unprecedented rate and scale of change in food systems and environmental settings will continue to out pace the ability of human physiology and ecosystems to adapt and evolve the bidirectional relationship between dietary patterns and the ecosystems may present an increasing number of tradeoffs to consider when prepar ing dietary guidance for promoting healthy and sustain able diets for example there are complex environmental and health considerations when comparing diets contain ing high amounts of animalbased foods such as meat chicken and eggs plantbased foods such as legumes and vegetables which are minimally processed and novel plantbased food products designed to mimic and replace animalbased foods and which generally are ultrapro cessed plant and novel plantbased diets typically have smaller environmental footprints than animalbased diets though the alignment of their nutrient profiles with healthy diets is mixed and those containing high amounts of ultraprocessed products are associated with longer term adverse health outcomes one study modelling dietary recommendations for reducing the amount of animalsource foods in diets in a large part to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions showed that dietary intakes of vitamin b calcium iron and zinc would be below the recommended nutrient intakes for adults and women of reproductive age these dynamic circum stances highlight the importance of policymakers being able to discern the level of processing of different types of plant and novel plantbased foods as well as using nuanced decisionmaking approaches to consider the range of environmental and health benefits and risks of these foods a future priority will be constant investiga tion of associations between dietary patterns and health and sustainability outcomes as well as ongoing review of the evidence base that informs dietary guidelines into the future guidance on healthy and sustainable diets will need to continue to be based on the synthesis of the best available evidence of associations between dietary patterns and physiological and increasingly plan etary health outcomes yet dietary guidelines do not speak for themselves the investment in their preparation will need to extend to investment in their promulgation to nutrition researchers policymakers and practitioners and their subsequent translation into foodlevel

fundamental strategies for healthy eating they include emphasizing healthful unsaturated fats whole grains good protein packages and fruits and vegetables limiting consumption of trans and saturated

all life stages from young adulthood through planning for pregnancy pregnancy and on into old age keywords diet health cardiovascular disease cancer pregnancy fertility introduction what is a healthy diet many clinicians find themselves at a loss to answer this common question from patients the difficulty of offering a simple answer is understandable the overwhelming volume of data generated by food and nutrition researchers coupled with sometimes contradictory findings the seeming flipflops in recommendations and the flood of misinformation in diet books and the media can make it seem as though explaining the essentials of healthy eating is akin to describing the intricacies of particle physics that is unfortunate because there are now enough solid strands of evidence from reliable sources to weave simple but compelling recommendations about diet in the united states and other developed countries the average woman can expect to live years or more with such longevity it isnt enough merely to consume the calories needed to sustain the body build it and repair it the foods that supply these calories can influence the risk of developing chronic conditions which range from heart disease and cancer to osteoporosis and agerelated vision loss although much remains to be learned about the role of specific nutrients in decreasing the risk of chronic disease a large body of

development of thousands of fatfree but calorieladen foods it has also helped fuel the twin epidemics of obesity and type diabetes the message fat is bad is problematic because there are four main types of dietary fat with dramatically different effects on health trans fats from partially hydrogenated oils are undeniably bad for the cardiovascular system and the rest of the body these largely manmade fats elevate harmful lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol reduce protective highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol stimulate inflammation and cause a variety of other changes that damage arteries and impair cardiovascular health higher intake of trans fat has been associated with an increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease type diabetes gall stones dementia and weight gain saturated fats from red meat and dairy products increase harmful ldl but also increase hdl a moderate intake of saturated fat under of daily calories is compatible with a healthy diet whereas consumption of greater amounts has been associated with cardiovascular disease monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats from vegetable oils seeds nuts whole grains and fishespecially the polyunsaturated omega fatty acids are important components of a healthy diet and are also essential for cardiac health eating polyunsaturated fats in place of saturated and trans fats lowers harmful ldl elevates protective hdl improves sensitivity to insulin and stabilizes heart rhythms dietary fat per se is not associated with risk of chronic disease in fact diets that include up to of calories from fat can be quite healthy if they are low in trans and saturated fat and emphasize polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat although definitive data are not available on the optimal proportions of dietary fats a low intake of trans and saturated fat and a higher intake of unsaturated fats reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes carbohydrates in the united states the reduction in the intake of dietary fat from of calories in to approximately today was accompanied by an increase in the intake of carbohydrates these extra carbohydrates were largely in the form of highly processed grains processing removes fiber healthful fats and an array of vitamins minerals and phytonutrients making processed grains such as white flour or white rice nutritionally impoverished compared with wholegrain versions consumption of a diet rich in highlyskerrett and willett page j midwifery womens health author manuscript available in pmc october nihpa author manuscript nihpa author manuscript nihpa author manuscript processed grains is associated with an increase in triglycerides and a reduction in protective hdl these adverse responses may be aggravated in the context of insulin resistance which often develops during pregnancy the prevalence of insulin resistance and type diabetes are both increasing in the united states and around the world the glycemic index the glycemic response refers to the measurable increase in blood sugar after consuming carbohydrates the greater the postprandial spike in glucose a food generates the greater that foods glycemic index highly refined grains cause a more rapid and a greater overall increase in blood sugar than lessrefined whole grains greater glycemic responses are accompanied by increased plasma insulin levels which are thought to be at the root of metabolic syndrome and have also been implicated in ovulatory infertility diets with a high glycemic index or glycemic load the product of dietary glycemic index and total carbohydrate intake appear to increase the risks of type diabetes and coronary artery disease particularly among women who have some insulin resistance the dramatic loss of fiber and micronutrients during the milling process may also contribute to these adverse effects of highly processed grains in contrast whole grains and foods made from whole grains along with fruits vegetables and beans provide slowly digested carbohydrates that are rich in fiber vitamins minerals and phytonutrients a substantial body of evidence indicates that eating whole grains or cereals high in fiber rather than highly refined grains reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and type diabetes although reductions in the risk of colon cancer by diets rich in wholegrain fiber have been difficult to document such a dietary pattern has been clearly associated with reductions in constipation and diverticular disease protein to the metabolic systems engaged in protein production and repair it is immaterial whether amino acids come from animal or plant protein however protein is not consumed in isolation instead it is packaged with a host of other nutrients the quality and amount of fats carbohydrates sodium and other nutrients in the protein package may influence longterm health for example results from the nurses health study suggest that eating more protein from beans nuts seeds and the like while cutting back on easily digested carbohydrates reduces the risk of heart disease in that study eating more animal protein while cutting back on carbohydrates did not reduce heart disease risk possibly because of the fats and other nutrients that come along or dont come along with protein from animals vegetables and fruits eat more fruits and vegetables is timeless advice that has the backing of a large body of evidence vegetables and fruits provide fiber slowly digested carbohydrates vitamins and minerals and numerous phytonutrients that have been associated with protection against cardiovascular disease agingrelated vision loss due to cataract and macular degeneration and maintenance of bowel function the connection between vegetables and fruits and cancer is less well established although they do not have a blanket anticancer effect fruits and vegetables may work against specific cancers including esophageal stomach lung and colorectal cancer fruits and vegetables should be consumed in abundance which means a minimum of five servings a dayand more is better as few as in persons in the united states meet this guidelineskerrett and willett page j

owithout any calories or additives water has all of those qualifications from the tap it costs a fraction of a penny per glass after water the two most commonly consumed beverages are tea and coffee both are remarkably safe beverages and have been associated with reduced risks of type diabetes kidney stones and gallstones and possibly heart disease and some types of cancer two problematic beverages are sugarsweetened drinks sodas fruit drinks juices sports drinks etc and alcoholic drinks one ounce can of sugarsweetened cola delivers teaspoons of sugar approximately empty calories not surprisingly daily consumption of sugary beverages has been associated with weight gain and increased risk of type diabetes heart disease and gout alcohol in moderation no more than one drink a day for women drinks a day for men has been associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and type diabetes on the other hand even moderate drinking may increase the risk of breast cancer however it is possible that a diet rich in folate may attenuate this risk in the nurses health study the risk of breast cancer associated with alcohol intake was strongest among women with total folate intake less than gd for alcohol intake grams gd vs gd which is the alcohol content of one standard drink the multivariate relative risk rr was confidence interval ci for women who consumed at least gd of total folate there was no increased risk of breast cancer associated with alcohol intake drinking alcohol during pregnancy is not recommended due to possible health hazards to the developing child vitamins and minerals an optimal diet generally provides all the vitamins minerals and other micronutrients needed for good health however many women in the us and a very large percentage of poor women do not follow optimal diets thus for most women a daily multivitamin multimineral supplement provides good insurance against nutritional deficiencies such supplements usually include extra iron which is needed by the to of premenopausal women with iron deficiency the most firmly established benefit of vitamin supplements is that additional folic acid can reduce the risk of neural tube defects by approximately current guidelines call for all women of childbearing age to take a daily supplement containing to micrograms g of folic acid or milligrams mg for women with a child with a neural tube defect calcium is important for the maintenance of bone strength precisely how much calcium is needed is a controversial question world health organization guidelines recommend an intake of mgday in the united kingdom mgday is considered adequate for women aged years and older in the united states dietary guidelines recommend that adult women receive mg of calcium daily in large part by consuming servings of lowfat or fatfree dairy products a day a lowercalorie nofat option is to get calcium from supplements for maintaining bone strength other factorsincluding physical activity and vitamin d are as important or more important than calcium there is mounting evidence that current recommendations for vitamin d iuday depending on age are too low and that iuday

competing with vitamin d however elevated risk is seen at intakes slightly higher than the current dietary reference intake of g per day given this concern a multivitamin that delivers much of its vitamin a as betacarotene is preferred weight control exercise body weight sits like a spider at the center of a web of health and disease excess weight predisposes an individual to the development of a host of chronic conditions the higher the body mass index bmi kgm the greater the prevalence of abnormal blood glucose lipids and blood pressure hypertension and cardiovascular disease diabetes many cancers gallstones sleep apnea complications of pregnancy infertility and premature mortality under the current national guidelines a bmi between and kgm is considered optimal and the best health experience is achieved by avoiding increases in weight during adulthood maintaining a healthy body weight or losing weight is a direct function of calories consumed and expended portion control is essential for weight maintenance the percentage of calories from dietary fat has little relationship with weight maintenance while low consumption of sugary beverages and trans fats and higher intake of dietary fiber appear to be helpful regular exercise and the avoidance of extreme inactivity such as excessive television watching are also integral strategies for weight control a supportive social and physical environment are also important dietary patterns although research on nutrients such as fats carbohydrates and specific vitamins and minerals has been revealing it has also generated some dead ends along with myths and confusion about what constitutes healthy eating a key reason is because people eat food not nutrients furthermore humans tend to follow relatively repeatable dietary patterns although it is harder to study dietary patterns than it is to study nutrients new research has shown how some dietary patterns are good for longterm health one dietary pattern that may harm longterm health is the typical western dietrich in red meat highly processed grains and sugar and lacking in fruits vegetables whole grains and fiber a host of studies have emphasized that this type of dietary pattern promotes atherosclerosis and a variety of cardiovascular conditions including heart attack and stroke peripheral vascular disease and heart failure one alternative is provided by the dietary guidelines for americans these guidelines are revised every five years by a panel that was once appointed by the us department of agriculture usda the department of health and human services is now also involved in the process according to the usda the guidelines provide authoritative advice for people two years and older about how good dietary habits can promote health and reduce risk for major chronic diseases in an effort to make the guidelines more accessible to the public they were initially distilled into the food guide pyramid unfortunately this ubiquitous symbol illustrated the goals of us agriculture as much as it represented the principles of healthful eating the food guide pyramid offered no guidance on grains it lumped together red meat poultry fish and beans and it asked us to judge these protein sources by their total fat content the food guide pyramid promoted drinking three glasses of lowfat milk or eating three servings of other dairy products per day and made no distinction between types of fat recommending that fat be consumed sparingly the food guide pyramid was retired in and replacedskerrett and willett page j midwifery womens health author manuscript available in pmc october nihpa author manuscript nihpa author manuscript nihpa author manuscript with the abstract mypyramid figure which cannot be deciphered without access to the accompanying web site the replacement of food groups with vertical stripes orange for grains green for vegetables red for fruits yellow for oils blue for dairy and purple for meat and beans was a win for the food industry which took issue with the original food guide pyramid because it represented foods near the bottom as good and those near the top as bad the lefttoright design presents all foods as being nutritionally equal a better dietary pattern is embodied in the healthy eating pyramid figure which was developed by faculty members in the department of nutrition at harvard school of public health based on the best available evidence the dietary strategies embodied in this pyramid are summarized in table for individuals who would rather follow a set dietary pattern instead of building their own based on the healthy eating pyramid a mediterraneantype diet or the dash diet can have profoundly positive effects on health table mediterranean diet traditional diets developed in countries surrounding the mediterranean sea have been linked with lower rates of heart disease and other chronic conditions such diets also appear to transplant well to foreign soil among the women participating in the national institutes of health aarp diet and health study those whose diets most closely matched a traditional mediterranean diet had reduced risks of allcause mortality multivariate hazard ratio ci cardiovascular mortality hr ci and cancer mortality hr ci compared with those following a western diet a similar trend was observed for men the impact was even greater among smokers the mediterranean diet has other health benefits as well such as reduced risk of cancer parkinsons disease and alzheimers disease it has also been associated with control of asthma and improvement in rheumatoid arthritis although there is no single diet that can be called the mediterranean diet those worthy of the name are high in extra virgin olive oil high in whole grain foods and fiber and rich in fruits vegetables legumes and nuts small portions of cheese and yogurt are eaten daily fish is consumed in varying amounts red meat poultry eggs and sweets are consumed sparingly modest amounts of red wine complement meals and regular physical activity is a part of daily life an example of a mediterraneantype diet is listed in the table a dash of prevention in the s the national heart lung and blood institute sponsored a randomized controlled trial called dietary approaches to stop hypertension dash to see if certain changes in diet could lower blood pressure the dash diet emphasized fruits vegetables and lowfat dairy foods and limited red meat saturated fats and sweets compared with an average american diet the dash diet lowered participants systolic blood pressure by an average of mm hg and diastolic pressure by mm hg a lowsodium dash approach was even more effective the results were comparable to those from trials of antihypertensive medications the impact of the dash diet goes beyond lowering blood pressure it has since been shown to reduce weight the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke and the development of kidney stones details of the

some turn to assisted reproduction others struggle in silence although farmers and ranchers have long recognized a connection between diet and fertility in farm animals surprisingly little research has been done into connections between the two in humans the largest longest and most systematic investigation of associations between diet and fertility was recently conducted as part of the nurses health study the participants of the diet and fertility substudy included women who said on one of the nurses health study biennial surveys that they were trying to become pregnant none of women had

a combination of five or more lowrisk lifestyle factors including diet weight control and physical activity was associated with a lower risk of ovulatory disorder infertility and an estimated population attributable risk of confidence interval box dietary strategies observed in the nurses health study that reduced the risk of ovulatory infertility avoid trans fats include more unsaturated vegetable oils in the diet such as olive oil or canola oil and cut back on saturated fat from red meat and other sources eat more vegetable protein like beans and nuts and less animal protein choose whole grains and other sources of carbohydrate that have lower slower effects on blood sugar and insulin rather than highly refined carbohydrates temporarily trade in skim milk and low or nofat dairy products like cottage cheese and frozen yogurt for their fullfat counterparts take a multivitamin that contains folic acid and other b vitamins get plenty of iron from fruits vegetables beans and supplements but not from red meat limit the intake of sugared sodas aim for a healthy weight if needed losing between and percent of starting weight may improve ovulation women who are sedentary or overweight should begin regular exercise lean women who exercise strenuously should cut back to moderate exercise diet and pregnancy good nutrition can optimize maternal health throughout pregnancy reduce the risk of birth defects promote optimal fetal growth and development and prevent chronic health problems in the developing child the american college of obstetrics and gynecology and the american dietetic association recommend that women generally follow the dietary guidelines for americans before becoming pregnant and during pregnancy other key strategies include appropriate weight gain appropriate physical activity vitamin folic acid and mineral iron supplementation as needed and avoiding alcohol tobacco and other harmful substances recent advisories about mercury in fish have prompted some women to avoid eating fish during pregnancy however the omega fatty acids in many types of fish promote healthy fetal development eating average amounts of seafood containing low levels of mercury during pregnancy has not been shown to cause problems the food and drug administration and environmental protection agency advise women who are pregnant or breastfeeding that it is safe to

the majority of studies indicate that epa has efficacy in treating depression and in moderate doses epa and dha appear safe for pregnant and postpartum women the kaludjerovic and vieth article illustrates that inadequate vitamin d nutrition during perinatal development is a threat to human health and due to the risks of exposure to sunlight provides current recommendations for vitamin d supplementation diet and weight control almost any diet will result in weight loss at least for a short time if it helps the dieter take in fewer calories than she burns few dieters however are able to sustain weightloss diets for long periods different palates food preferences family situations and even genes mean that no single diet is right for everyone what is needed is a dietary pattern that can be sustained for years and that is as good for the heart bones brain psyche and taste buds as it is for the waistline this diet should include plenty of choices and few restrictions or special foods data from randomized trials suggest that the nutrient makeup of a dietary pattern for weight loss matters far less than the number of calories it delivers in a headtohead trial of four diets loosely based on the atkins ornish and mediterranean diets low fat average protein low fat high protein high fat average protein and high fat high protein respectively participants lost an average of pounds kg at months and had a inch reduction in waist size regardless of the diets they were following at months most began to regain some weight among those who completed the trial the amount of weight loss after years was similar in participants assigned to a diet with protein and those assigned to a diet with protein average of and kg respectively p and was also the same in those assigned to a diet with fat and those assigned to a diet with fat average of and kg respectively p there was no effect of carbohydrate level on weight loss within the target range of to of calories from carbohydrate the change in waist circumference was also similar across the diet groups feelings of hunger satiety and satisfaction with the diet were the same across the board as were cholesterol levels and other markers of cardiovascular risk it is important to note that these averages hide huge variations in weight loss with some participants losing pounds or more while others actually gained weight during the trial this supports the idea that weightloss strategies must be individualized group counseling was an aid to weight loss suggesting that behavioral psychological and social factors are probably more important for weight loss than the mix of nutrients in a diet conclusions although much solid information on optimal diets has emerged the full picture of the relationships between diet and health will take years of further research to fill in yet several fundamentals have been established and are unlikely to change significantly these include the seven general strategies listed in table it is impossible to cover all this ground in a minute office visit however it is possible to make several general points offer a handout and direct a patient to more information if a patient is overweight the most important general points should be about portion control avoiding sugary beverages and exercise weight is probably at least as important for long term
